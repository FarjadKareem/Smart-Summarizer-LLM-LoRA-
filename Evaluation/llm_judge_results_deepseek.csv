"a major goal of neutron star ( ns ) research has remained unrealized despite 30 years of effort - to determine the fundamental properties of the superdense matter in a ns interior , in particular its equation of state ( eos ) and composition . 
 there are many approaches which can be employed in this effort ( @xcite and references therein ) , but one of the most intensively studied is to exploit the thermal radiation from isolated ns . 
 this radiation can be used to deduce information about the eos from neutron star cooling theory @xcite . 
 extracting information about the ns interior is not straightforward , however , since the observed spectrum does not represent the ns surface emission , but is modified by radiative transfer effects in the ns atmosphere . 
 the problem of unfolding the observed spectrum and understanding ns interiors thus depends on deducing the composition of the atmosphere . 
 ns atmospheres are interesting in their own right . we know 
 little about their nature , other than that some ns probably have hydrogen atmospheres @xcite , since they fit well to the sophisticated h - atmosphere models that have been developed @xcite . 
 the observations have been silent on the question of whether non - hydrogen atmospheres exist . 
 the ns 1e1207.4 - 5209was discovered by @xcite with the einstein observatory and is associated with the snr pks 1209 - 51 . 
 subsequent observations established it as a prototypical radio silent ns associated with a snr @xcite . 
 rosat and asca observations were fit with a black - body spectrum @xcite and a hydrogen atmosphere model @xcite . 
 no x - ray pulsations were detected . 
 _ chandra_detected x - ray pulsations with @xmath2 s @xcite . while this is perhaps not surprising in light of previous work , 
 the small period derivative estimated @xcite certainly was unexpected . 
 the inferred surface b - field is @xmath3 g.    even more remarkable , @xcite ( hereafter szpt ) have discovered features at @xmath4 kev and @xmath5 kev are required to obtain acceptable fits to the spectrum ( which was fit with a @xmath6 k underlying black - body continuum ) . 
 a feature of marginal significance and unclear origin was also noted at @xmath7 kev . a subsequent observation by _ xmm - newton_@xcite has provided some hint of substructure in the features , and has marginally detected the @xmath7 kev feature seen by _ 
 chandra_.    three different phenomenological fits indicative of either absorption lines or edges were used by szpt to fit the two strong features . of enormous significance 
 , the spectrum was shown to be inconsistent with hydrogen atmosphere models . the intense effort which has gone into the hydrogen atmosphere models and their success in explaining other ns observations 
 @xcite lends credence to the inevitable conclusion that the atmosphere of 1e1207.4 - 5209is something other than hydrogen . 
 unfortunately , as pointed out elsewhere @xcite , work on non - hydrogen atmospheres at high b - fields is much less developed . 
 szpt argued on various grounds that the features could not arise via cyclotron lines . 
 instead they tentatively suggested emission from a once ionized - helium atmosphere with a b - field of @xmath8 g. this b - field is inconsistent with that derived from the spin parameters , but szpt argue this could be due to an off - centered b - field or glitches affecting the @xmath9 measurement . 
 others have argued for a cyclotron line solution at lower b - field @xcite . 
 @xcite claimed an atmosphere of iron or other high - z elements at a b - field of @xmath1 g , although they did not actually fit their _ xmm - newton_data to a model . 
 in this paper we offer alternate interpretations of these spectral features . 
 all our interpretations involve atomic transitions , mainly in he - like ions of mid - z elements at @xmath10 g , consistent with the b - field derived from the ns spin properties . 
 the most likely of these interpretations is that the ns atmosphere contains oxygen or neon ; most noteworthy is that _ all _ our models , whether considering just the two strong features or including the third weak feature , demand mid - z elements for an acceptable solution . 
 our model , combined with the _ xmm - newton_and _ chandra_data , easily rule out the iron and high - z solutions of @xcite . 
 some comments are in order on our approach . 
 the atomic spectroscopy data used in this analysis is based on a novel approach for obtaining fast and accurate solutions to the schrdinger equation for b - fields in the landau regime ( appropriate for all cases considered here ) . 
 this approach , multiconfigurational , perturbative , hybrid , hartree , hartree - fock theory , allows rapid computation of transition energies and oscillator strengths for arbitrary atom , ion , excitation state and b - field ( @xcite , hereafter mh02a ) . 
 this permits a complete search of all possible spectroscopic transitions consistent with the given line or edge energies .    while it may appear that this approach produces an uninterestingly large number of potential solutions , we demonstrate in a companion paper ( @xcite , hereafter mh02b ) that this is not the case . 
 we show that the presence of two or more line or edge features provides a remarkable robustness to a host of poorly - understood atomic physics effects and unambiguously restricts the atmosphere composition to mid - z elements . 
 we only briefly mention our data reduction here , as our approach closely follows that of szpt . 
 indeed , we emphasize that none of our conclusions here would be modified if we simply used the spectral line parameters derived by szpt . 
 our analysis is described in more detail in mh02b . 
 the results presented here are for phase - integrated spectra only . subsequent work will consider phase - resolved data , which can provide more information on the system geometry . 
 we fit the spectrum with two models : a blackbody with two absorption edges ( edge model ) and a blackbody with two absorption lines ( line model ) . 
 as noted by szpt , these spectral features are required to get acceptable fits . 
 the fit parameters for our models are given in table [ tab_fit ] . 
 we show the raw _ chandra_spectrum in figure [ fig_bb ] overlaid with a blackbody to clearly indicate the presence of the absorption features . 
 figures [ fig_lineedge ] show the results of our best fit line and edge models . 
 we briefly review the quantum numbers of bound electrons in b - fields in the landau regime . 
 states are labeled by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the magnetic quantum number and @xmath13 is the longitudinal quantum number . 
 the @xmath14 states have larger binding energy than the @xmath15 states . 
 consistent with the terminology of mh02a , we call the former tightly - bound states and the latter loosely - bound states . generally the ground state of an ion is a tightly - bound state . in the x - ray band transitions are mostly likely to be either photo - absorption ( tightly - bound state to continuum ) or absorption lines from tightly - bound to loosely - bound state ( tight - loose transition ) . 
 tight - tight transitions appear in the optical band . 
 details of the transition selection rules are discussed elsewhere ( mh02a , mh02b ) . 
 we first considered the two strongest features at @xmath4 kev and @xmath5 kev and assume both features are due to atomic transitions in a single element and ionization state ( case a ) . 
 this effectively defines a solution for the dominant absorbing element in terms of he - like ions . 
 li - like ions and those in lower ionization states are not dominant absorbers under the expected atmospheric conditions ( mh02b ) . 
 h - like ions can not be the dominant absorbers because this is grossly incommensurate with the features relative widths and strengths even under conditions far removed from local thermodynamic equilibrium ( mh02b ) . 
 h - like ions can , however , be present since the relevant spectral features will be blended with the he - like features . in the he - like ions , 
 the electrons are making tight - loose transitions out of the @xmath16 ground state to the @xmath17 excited states respectively , or to the continuum . 
 neither tightly - bound states at higher magnetic quantum number nor non - adjacent tightly - bound states are acceptable . in the former case the feature energy ratios can not be produced and in the latter case unobserved features in the _ chandra_band would be produced . 
 we searched for any combination of element , redshift and b - field which could give the observed positions of the spectral features . 
 our b - field range was @xmath18 g to @xmath19 g. in the case of edge solutions we also permitted ( small ) pressure shifts ( details in mh02b ) . 
 line solutions are insensitive to pressure shifts . 
 the properties of the solutions including derived values of the b - field and redshift are shown in table [ tab_summary ] . 
 the first two solutions involve atomic line transitions in he - like oxygen and neon and the third solution he - like neon absorption edges . 
 a similar oxygen solution was rejected because its redshift was too low , violating causality and stability conditions for the ns interior @xcite . 
 for the neon edge solution there is an electron cyclotron line in the _ chandra_/_xmm - newton_energy band but it was made to overlap the higher energy spectral feature by introducing a small pressure shift ( @xmath20 ev ) . 
 such pressure shifts slightly affect the energy ratio of the two edge features and serve to further constrain other elements and conditions of the atmosphere ( mh02b ) . the line and edge widths are all consistent with expectations for stark broadening and non - constant b - field broadening respectively ( mh02b ) . 
 our case b assumes that one spectral feature is an atomic transition and the second is a cyclotron line . 
 a 1.4 kev or 0.7 kev electron cyclotron line defines a b - field of @xmath21 g or @xmath22 g respectively . in the former case solutions can only be found for h - like ions transitioning out of the @xmath23 ground state to the @xmath24 excited state or the continuum . 
 these are all mid - z solutions albeit with lower b - field than those considered above . in the case of a 0.7 kev electron cyclotron line , 
 the b - field is low enough that our perturbation method breaks down for higher landau levels and is therefore less accurate ; we estimate that putative solutions would involve the elements beryllium or boron and are therefore implausible . 
 if one of the features is a nuclear cyclotron line then the other feature must be a transition from the ground state of either helium or hydrogen . 
 however there is no combination of @xmath25 and @xmath26 that can reproduce the line positions . 
 thus nuclear cyclotron lines are ruled out . 
 although case b is formally allowed we consider it highly unlikely . 
 there are difficulties in attempting to reconcile the depth and width of the spectral features ( mh02b ) . 
 nevertheless it is interesting that even this scenario including cyclotron lines only admits solutions involving mid - z elements . 
 table [ tab_summary ] also shows proposed solutions if the feature at @xmath7 kev is confirmed ( case c solutions ) . 
 again it is of importance to note that only mid - z solutions are acceptable . 
 we had to relax one of our previous assumptions by assuming additional significant absorption from h - like ions . 
 an admixture of h - like ions in a given atmosphere is quite plausible for reasonable conditions of temperature and density ( mh02b ) . 
 the first case considered is identical to the he - like oxygen / neon case presented above but with the addition of a h - like oxygen / neon absorption edge due to the @xmath23 ground state to continuum transition . in this model 
 the other h - like lines overlap the he - like lines so no additional features are produced . 
 the second solution invokes photoabsorption edges in he - like neon for the two lower energy features and the higher energy feature is due to an electron cyclotron line . 
 our most important conclusion is that _ all _ viable solutions for b - fields comparable to that inferred from the ns spin parameters require mid - z atmospheres in both the two and three spectral feature case . 
 our solutions which most closely correspond to the inferred b - field demand he - like oxygen and neon . 
 in contrast to this paper , szpt proposed ultrahigh b - field solutions . 
 their helium atmosphere appears problematic , however . in order to get the right feature positions szpt s 
 h - like helium features must of necessity arise in transitions from electrons in the @xmath23 or @xmath27 quantum states to @xmath24 and @xmath28 states . 
 the @xmath24 state is heavily depopulated at the types of ion densities one expects and the @xmath28 state is actually autoionized due to the large nuclear cyclotron energy . in fact the motional stark shift and pressure effects in helium will likely destroy all the loosely - bound states . 
 consequently one is forced to assume the features are absorption edges , and this leads to severe difficulty explaining the relative edge strengths ( mh02b ) . 
 @xcite did not fit their _ xmm - newton_data , but proposed nevertheless that the spectral features could be attributed to iron or some other high - z element at a field @xmath1 g. our current work rules out their proposal . 
 there is no combination of b - field , redshift , element or ionization states , even with unphysical , arbitrary pressure shifts , that is consistent with the _ xmm - newton_and _ chandra_data . 
 the interpretation we present here makes an important prediction : the observed features may show substantial substructure when observed with higher spectral resolution . 
 transition energies from the tightly bound ground state to loosely bound final excited states differing in longitudinal quantum number are rather close to each other , and may be blended . 
 details of predicted energies and transition assignments are presented in mh02b . 
 whether detailed atmospheric models would lead to a washing out of this substructure through broadening is not clear , but its detection would certainly confirm that the features are atomic transitions since we would not expect similar substructure in cyclotron lines . 
 in fact , @xcite claim a marginal detection of such substructure .    concerning the b - field derived from the free parameter fits to the data , we note that our neon and oxygen line solutions are all within a factor of two or three of the b - field derived from spin parameters . 
 the discrepancy may lie in the ns b - field geometry or line blending . 
 line blending will affect our b - field ( and redshift ) estimate , but will not affect our element identifications . 
 the analysis here , along with that of szpt , begs the question of why there is anything in the atmosphere other than hydrogen . 
 oxygen or neon are expected constituents near the ns mass cut in many models of supernova explosions @xcite . indeed due to turbulent mixing in such explosions oxygen 
 can be found throughout the core @xcite . but given that a very thin layer of hydrogen accreted from the interstellar medium is enough to produce an optically thick hydrogen atmosphere , we are left to ponder mechanisms by which such accretion can be inhibited , or at least permit simultaneous emission from a mid - z element . 
 one possibility is that the timescale for an optically thick layer to accrete onto the surface is shorter than that for gravitational stratification in the atmosphere @xcite . in that case , even trace amounts of mid - z elements could lead to strong emission @xcite . 
 optical observations of the associated snr indicate the presence of oxygen and it has been argued that the unusually high galactic latitude of this ns implies the oxygen originated in the progenitor star @xcite 
 . thus a rich source of oxygen is available . 
 alternately the mid - z atmosphere may be associated with the ns mass cut , and a propeller effect may be severely inhibiting accretion of hydrogen . 
 we note that several of our proposed solutions allow a hydrogen - rich environment ( mh02b ) .    for more progress to be made on 1e1207.4 - 5209it 
 will be necessary to develop complete models of ns atmosphere for mid - z elements incorporating the more sophisticated atomic data bases we have utilized here . 
 this source has much to tell us in the years to come , especially when higher resolution spectroscopic observations become available .      ,

The repetitive and irrelevant lines further detract from coverage."
"we present here l and m band results on v4332 sgr . 
 recent studies of v4332 sgr have shown that it is an interesting object and the present results further support this view . 
 v4332 sgr erupted in 1994 in a nova - like outburst with an outburst amplitude of 9.5 magnitude in the visible region . 
 there was only one detailed study of the object during its outburst ( martini et al . 
 1999 ) which showed that its eruption was different from that of a classical nova or other classes of eruptive variables . 
 interest in the object has been rekindled because of the recent outburst of v838 mon which drew considerable attention due to its light - echo ( munari et al . 
 2002 ; bond et al . 
 it is believed that v838 mon , v4332 sgr and m31 rv ( a red - variable which exploded in m31 in 1988 ; rich et al . 
 1989 ) could be members of a new class of eruptive objects ( munari et al . 
 2002 ; bond et al . 
 2003 , kimeswenger et al . 
 the cause of the outburst in these objects does not appear to be satisfactorily explained by conventional mechanisms . 
 thus new theories have been proposed viz . 
 a scenario involving the merger of main sequence stars ( soker @xmath2 tylenda , 2003 ) and a hypothesis invoking planetary - capture by an expanding star to explain the eruption ( retter @xmath2 marom , 2003 ) . 
 the present data indicate that the second mechanism could be viable in v4332 sgr . 
 recent infrared studies of v4332 sgr have detected several bands of alo at a low rotational temperature of 200 - 300k ( banerjee et al . 
 a considerable change in the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the object was seen between 2mass data of 1998 and observations in 2003 indicating the formation of a dust shell between these two epochs ( banerjee et al . 
 2003 ) . a better estimate of the epoch when the dust actually formed is discussed here . 
 optical spectroscopy of v4332 sgr in 2003 , showed an interesting spectrum dominated by very strong emission in the resonance lines of ki and nai ( banerjee @xmath2 ashok 2004 ) . 
 the sed of the star , derived from optical and ir data , indicated a central star with a black - body temperature of 3250k and an ir excess attributed to a dust component at @xmath3 900k ( banerjee @xmath2 ashok 2004 ) . 
 observations were done using the 3.8 m uk infrared telescope ( ukirt ) . 
 spectroscopy was done using the ukirt imaging spectrometer ( uist ) , which uses different grisms to cover the 1.4 - 5 micron range . 
 @xmath4 ( 3.77 @xmath0 m ) and @xmath5 ( 4.68 @xmath0 m ) band photometry - not available earlier for v4332 sgr - was also done using uist . 
 flat - fielding , spectral calibration and other reduction procedures were done on the same lines as our earlier @xmath6 study of v4332 sgr ( banerjee et al . 
 2003).the log of the observations and the observed @xmath7 magnitudes of v4332 sgr are given in table 1 . 
 figure 1 shows the spectrum - the a - x bands of alo in the @xmath8 band , reported earlier ( banerjee et al . 
 2003 ) are seen prominently in the present spectrum also but are not discussed here . a remarkable feature 
 - never seen before in a nova - like object - is the deep , solid - state 3.05 @xmath0 m water - ice band formed due to the o - h stretching mode . at very low temperatures , atoms and molecules 
 can collide and adhere to a dust grain to produce an ice mantle on the surface . 
 atoms can migrate from one site to another on the mantle to form a molecule - water ice is believed to form this way with h atoms combining with an o atom . 
 the presence of cold water - ice around v4332 sgr is extremely unexpected since the ejecta of classical novae generally evolve to high temperatures of @xmath3 10@xmath9k ( the coronal phase ) . 
 following a standard procedure , we have obtained the optical depth plot of the ice feature by fitting a polynomial to the continuum around it ( gibb et al . 
 the depth of the ice feature below this continuum was found and converted to an optical depth . 
 the optical depth plot is shown in figure 2 . 
 the 3.05 @xmath0 m feature was compared with laboratory data for the optical depth of water - ice at different temperatures ( 10 , 30 , 50 , 120 and 160k ) taken from the leiden database for ice analogslab/ ] . from a @xmath10@xmath11 test to the observed and model data , we find that the 50k data gives the smallest value of @xmath10@xmath11 . 
 the 30k data also gives a comparable value of @xmath10@xmath11 thus suggesting a low temperature of @xmath330 - 50k for the water ice . 
 an extended red wing between 3.3 - 3.8 @xmath0 m , which is not well fitted by the models , is seen in the observed data . 
 this extended ice wing is also seen in several water ice detections but the species responsible for it is unidentified ( gibb et al . 2004 ) . from figure 2 , 
 the column density of the water - ice @xmath12 was calculated using @xmath12 = @xmath13@xmath14d@xmath15/@xmath16 , where @xmath16 is the the band strength for water - ice with a laboratory measured value of @xmath16 = 20@xmath1710@xmath18 cm molecule@xmath19 . 
 while carrying out the integration , we have assumed that the missing data points around 2.65 @xmath0 m ( due to atmospheric cutoff ) , are represented by the data points of the 50k laboratory model in that region . 
 we obtain a value of @xmath13@xmath14d@xmath15 = 362@xmath2027 cm@xmath19 leading to @xmath12 = ( 1.81@xmath200.13)@xmath1710@xmath22 @xmath23 - this value may be used in case of future detection of other ices ( co@xmath24 , ch@xmath25oh , ch@xmath26 etc . ) in v4332 sgr to get a better understanding of the ice composition .    another rare feature seen in v4332 sgr is the fundamental band ( @xmath15 = 1 - 0 ) of @xmath1co at 4.67 @xmath0 m in emission . 
 there appear to be only a few other detections of the co fundamental in emission - mostly towards ysos and herbig aebe stars ( e.g. blake @xmath2 boogert 2004 ; pontoppidan et al . 
 in a few novae , emission in the co first overtone bands has been seen ( rudy et al . 
 2003 - table 3 therein ; evans et al . 
 1996 ) but the detection of the fundamental band appears rare ( lynch et al . 
 1997 ) . the expanded co ro - vibrational spectrum in v4332 sgr is shown in figure 3 . 
 individual branch lines from p@xmath27 to p@xmath28 and r@xmath29 to r@xmath28 are clearly seen . 
 the lines are not resolved at their intrinsic width at the observed resolution of 1000 . 
 a simple model for the @xmath1co emission was computed assuming lte conditions with the level populations proportional to ( 2j+1)e@xmath30 where b and j are the rotational constant for co and the rotational quantum number respectively ; t is the temperature . 
 the strength of each p or r branch line was then obtained using the transition probabilities for the lines given by goorvitch ( 1994 ) . 
 the line positions were also taken from goorvitch ( 1994 ) . 
 the model spectrum thus obtained was convolved with a gaussian instrument function of fwhm 0.046 @xmath0 m ( i.e. a resolution of 1000 ) . from the model 
 fits , it is difficult to constrain the temperature of the gas too accurately , but a relatively low temperature of @xmath3300 - 400k is suggested . this could possibly be the reason for the absence in v4332 sgr of the first overtone co bands at 2.3 - 2.45@xmath0 m which need a higher temperature for excitation . 
 these bands have been modeled to have a temperature in the range 2500 - 4500k in novae ( rudy et al . 
 2003 ; evans et al . 1996 ) . 
 further , the strong presence of alo bands in v4332 sgr in the same spectral region as the co first overtone bands , makes it difficult to draw definite conclusions on the absence / presence of the latter . a better estimate for the co temperature than that derived here would require modeling based on higher resolution spectra ( e.g. blake @xmath2 boogert 2004 ; pontoppidan et al . 
 2002 ) . 
 the detection of water ice at 30 - 50k in v4332 sgr is very intriguing since such a low temperature component is not expected in novae ejecta . 
 based on the recent comprehensive survey ( gibb et al . 
 2004 and references therein ) , most water - ice detections are seen towards embedded ysos / protostars . 
 such objects are known to have circumstellar disks ( csds ) around them . 
 in addition , water - ice has also been seen in herbig aebe stars and a few t tauri stars ( creech eakman et al . 2002 ; meeus et al . 
 2001 , gibb et al . 
 these are all young objects observationally known to possess csds . 
 furthermore , all the gaseous components of v4332 sgr are seen in emission i.e. the ki / nai , co , alo and tio lines ( banerjee @xmath2 ashok 2004 ; banerjee et al . 
 these species are at a low temperature ( 200k for alo ; a low excitation temperature is also implied for the ki / nai lines which need only @xmath3 1.5 - 2ev for excitation ) . 
 if the region in which these species exist were to be a shell surrounding the central 3250k star of v4332 sgr ( banerjee @xmath2 ashok 2004 ) , the relatively cold gas of these species should lead to lines in absorption . 
 such is not the case . instead 
 , if the various species are in a disk , their lines can be expected in emission . 
 furthermore , in the case of a disk , the central star would also be observable since it will be unobscured ( some obscuration could occur depending on the orientation and thickness of the disk ) . 
 such is the case in v4332 sgr where the continuum from the central star is clearly seen . 
 additional support for a csd is the infrared excess seen in v4332 sgr ( banerjee @xmath2 ashok 2004 ) . 
 this ir excess can be attributed to dust in the disk and not in a shell around the star since the dust shell would obscure the visible radiation of the star . 
 a similar reasoning is used to explain the ir excess in t tauri stars . 
 it is also relevant to note that many of the known co fundamental detections are in disk - dominated herbig ae stars ( blake @xmath2 boogert 2004 ) . 
 the considerable width of the ki lines in v4332 sgr was also shown to be consistent with line broadening arising from rotational motion of gas in a disk ( banerjee @xmath2 ashok 2004 ) . 
 an additional signature that v4332 sgr has pre - existing matter around it at the time of the 1994 outburst comes from the high - resolution h@xmath31 profiles of the object taken shortly after its outburst . 
 these profiles ( figure 8 of martini et al . 1999 ) show a deep absorption trough at the center which could be caused by absorption by pre - existing matter . therefore , many of the observed characteristics of v4332 sgr support the existence of a csd around the object . however , it is difficult to rule out the possibility of the matter being in clumps instead of a disk . 
 it may be pointed out that the maximum value of @xmath14 @xmath3   1 of the ice feature ( figure 2 ) , would imply a large extinction of a@xmath32 @xmath3 14 magnitudes towards the central star , had the 3.05@xmath0 m absorption arisen because of cold , intervening matter in the line of sight ( as in embedded ysos in dark clouds ; whittet 1992 ) . 
 as the central star appears unobscured ( v= 17.52 , banerjee @xmath2 ashok 2004 ) , the 3.05@xmath0 m feature could instead be caused by ice in the csd viewed against the ir flux from dust in the disc leading to the absorption feature . 
 it was earlier shown that the @xmath6 fluxes of v4332 sgr changed considerably between 2mass observations of may , 1998 ( @xmath33 = 12.1 , @xmath34 = 11.6 , @xmath35 = 10.992 ) and observations of june , 2003 ( @xmath33 = 13.25 , @xmath34 = 11.986 , @xmath35 = 10.023 ; banerjee et al . 
 while the 2 mass data showed no ir excess and was well modeled by a 3250k blackbody , the 2003 data showed a composite sed of a blackbody component at 900k ( due to newly formed dust ) and a weakening of the 3250k component due to obscuration by dust . 
 however , it was not possible to establish with accuracy at which stage between 1998 and 2003 the dust formed . 
 data from the denis survey is now available and this shows that in september , 1999 v4332 sgr had ir magnitudes of @xmath33= 12.46 and @xmath35 = 10.65 ( denis did not observe in @xmath34 band ) . 
 a comparison between 2mass and denis @xmath36 magnitudes clearly shows the ir flux increasing towards longer wavelengths indicating that dust formation had begun by the denis epoch . 
 the formation of dust therefore took place at t@xmath37 @xmath3 5.5 years after the outburst of february 1994 . 
 this is much larger than the typical timescale of 50 - 100 days for dust formation in classical novae . 
 the difficulty in having a large dust - condensation time in novae is that the density in the ejecta decreases to a low level - due to expansion - that does not favor dust - formation . 
 the density @xmath38 in the ejecta of novae that form dust is in the range 10@xmath39 to 10@xmath40g@xmath41 ( gehrz 1988 ) . in v4332 sgr 
 , the electron density n@xmath42 after @xmath3 2 - 3 months from the outburst was estimated to be 10@xmath43 @xmath41 ( martini et al . 
 1999 ) . a geometric dilution for the expanding ejecta matter may be a reasonable assumption i.e n@xmath42 @xmath31 1/r@xmath11 provided the ejecta expands freely , unhindered by pre - existing matter . 
 @xmath31 1/r@xmath11 , after a time of 5.5yr , n@xmath42 should have evolved to @xmath3 10@xmath44 @xmath41 giving a value of @xmath38 = 10@xmath18 - 10@xmath45g@xmath41 . 
 such a low value of @xmath38 appears unfavorable for dust formation . 
 it therefore appears that dust formation may not have occured per se in the ejecta of the 1994 outburst . 
 it is likely that the ejecta , after a stage of free expansion , could have impinged on pre - existing matter around v4332 sgr - sufficiently far from the star - thereby heating it and giving rise to the observed emission at present from different species . 
 this could be one possible scenario to explain the large observed time for the formation of dust . in a connected aspect 
 , we note that the present @xmath4 , @xmath5 data of figure 1 , shows the continuum peaking at @xmath3 4.4@xmath0 m indicating a lower , dust temperature than the 900k that was inferred earlier . 
 however , mid / far - ir observations planned on the spitzer telescope should give more definite information on the dust temperature . 
 more than a hundred stars with planets ( swps ) are known today and in @xmath315@xmath46 of these the planetary companion is unexpectedly close to the host star ( @xmath47 0.05 au ) . 
 the orbits of such short - period planets around sun - like stars can be unstable because of tidal dissipation and they can be subsequently consumed by the host stars ( sandquist et al . 2002 ; rasio et al . 
 more evolved stars are also capable of swallowing their planets as they expand ( siess @xmath2 livio 1999 ) . 
 the viability of planetary ingestion is observationally supported by the enhanced metallicity seen in many swps - and the presence of li isotopes in one of them - suggesting that planetary material has been accreted by the host star in the past ( santos et al . 
 2000 ; gonzalez et al . 2001 ; israelian et al . 
 2003 ) . in particular context of v4332 sgr type of objects , retter and marom ( 2003 ) have explained the multi - peak light curve of v838 mon as due to an expanding star ingesting its planets . 
 we have shown that there is considerable evidence that v4332 sgr is surrounded by a cold , dusty disk . 
 it is precisely in such an environment that planets are believed to be born from the coagulation and accretion of solid ice and dust particles ( lissauer 1993 ) . 
 therefore , while it may appear speculative , it is not entirely unlikely that a planet existed around v4332 sgr and its infall led to the outburst . 
 the plausibility of this scenario is strengthened since other conventional mechanisms - such as a thermo - nuclear runaway on a white dwarf surface ( invoked for classical , recurrent , symbiotic novae ) or a final helium shell flash ( invoked for a born - again agb star ) - fail to explain the pre- and post - outburst properties of v4332 sgr or similar objects . 
 it was shown ( retter @xmath2 marom 2003 ) in the analysis for v838 mon , that the gravitational energy released by a 1m@xmath48 planet falling into a solar - mass star is 4@xmath1710@xmath49l@xmath50 . 
 the outburst luminosity of v4332 sgr is difficult to estimate as the distance @xmath51 to the object is very uncertain . using an estimate of @xmath51 = 300 pc ( martini et al . 
 1999 ) we have shown that the star has a quiescent luminosity of   0.3@xmath52@xmath50 ( banerjee et al . 
 a 9.5 magnitude brightening at outburst would yield an outburst luminosity of @xmath3 2@xmath1710@xmath53l@xmath50 . 
 this is lower than the predicted energy release for the capture of a 1m@xmath48 planet but could be made consistent by revising the distance ( the current distance estimate to v838 mon has been revised upwards by a factor of nearly 10 from its first estimate ) , invoking a smaller mass for the captured planet or that a large part of the released gravitational energy has gone into expansion of the stellar envelope ( retter @xmath2 marom 2003 ) rather than visible radiation . 
 however , we feel there are many aspects about the nature of v4332 sgr that are still unclear and there is scope for alternative models , apart from that proposed here , to explain its outburst .

 recent studies of v4332 sgr have shown that it is an interesting object and the present results further support this view. 
 v4332 sgr erupted in 1994 in a nova - like outburst with an outburst amplitude of 9.5 magnitude in the visible region. 
 there was only one detailed study of the object during its outburst ( martini et al. 
 1999 ) which showed that its eruption was different from that of a classical nova or other classes of eruptive variables. 
 interest in the object has been rekindled because of the recent outburst of v838 mon which drew considerable attention due to its light - echo ( munari et al. 
 2002 ; bond et al. 
 it is believed that v838 mon, v4332 sgr and m31 rv ( a red - variable which exploded in m31 in 1988 ; rich et al. 
 1989 ) could be members of a new class of eruptive objects ( munari et al. 
 2002 ; bond et al. 
 2003, kimeswenger et al. 
 the cause of the outburst in these objects does not appear to be satisfactorily explained by conventional mechanisms. 
 thus new theories have been proposed viz. 
 a scenario involving the merger of main sequence stars ( soker @xmath2 tylenda, 2003 ) and a hypothesis invoking planetary - capture by an expanding star to explain the eruption ( retter @xmath2 marom, 2003 ). 
 the present data indicate that the second mechanism could be viable in v4332 sgr. 
 recent infrared studies of v4332 sgr have detected several bands of alo at a low rotational temperature of 200 - 300k ( banerjee et al. 
 a considerable change in the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the object was seen between 2mass data of 1998 and observations in 2003 indicating the formation of a dust shell between these two epochs ( banerjee et al. 
 2003 ). a better estimate of the epoch when the dust actually formed is discussed here. 
 optical spectroscopy of v4332 sgr in 2003, showed an interesting spectrum dominated by very strong emission in the resonance lines of ki and nai ( banerjee @xmath2 ashok 2004 ). 
 the sed of the object in 2003 was found to be similar to that of v838 mon ( banerjee @xmath2 ashok 2004 ). 
 this led to the suggestion that v4332 sgr and v838 mon could be members of a new class of eruptive objects ( banerjee @xmath2 ashok 2004 ). 
 the data presented here were obtained using the 2.2 - 2.8 @xmath3m telescope at the indian astrophysical research institute ( iari ), gujarat, india. 
 the observations were carried out in the l and m bands","Fluency: 5 - The summary is highly readable and grammatically correct, with clear and coherent sentences that flow well.  

Factuality: 4 - The summary accurately reflects the source, but there is a minor factual error regarding the telescope used (the source mentions the 3.8 m UK Infrared Telescope, not a 2.2-2.8m telescope in India). Otherwise, the key details are correct.  

Coverage: 4 - The summary covers the main problem (the nature of V4332 Sgr's eruption), methods (infrared observations), and key findings (unexpected water-ice detection, new eruptive object class). However, it omits some finer details like the black-body temperature and dust shell formation specifics."
"at a continuous transition , the expression @xmath13 for the leading critical behavior of a thermodynamic observable @xmath14 has the well known form @xmath15 where @xmath0 and @xmath16 are the transition temperature and the critical exponent respectively . for the concrete analysis of numerical data , a normalization factor with non - critical behavior at @xmath0 
 must be introduced . 
 the simplest and most traditional convention , which will be referred to below as @xmath17 scaling , is to normalize each @xmath18 by a temperature independent constant . for obvious reasons this constant 
 is chosen to be @xmath19 for each observable ; one then writes the normalized leading term as the familiar text - book expression : @xmath20^{-\rho_f } = { \cal   c}_{f}t^{-\rho_f } , \label{t_scaling}\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the critical amplitude ( see  [ ] for a detailed review ) . 
 an alternative and _ a priori _ equally valid choice is to write @xmath23^{-\rho_f } = { \cal c}_{f}[(t-\tc)/t]^{-\rho_f}\nonumber \\ & = & { \cal c}_{f}\left[1-\frac{\beta}{\bec}\right]^{-\rho_f } = { \cal c}_{f}\tau^{-\rho_f } , \label{beta_scaling}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the inverse temperature @xmath25 and @xmath26 . 
 note that the temperature dependence of the normalization is now different for each observable . 
 this `` @xmath24 scaling '' form has become the standard normalization for theoretical work on the critical properties of ferromagnets and analogous systems , see for instance  @xcite , although more complex normalizations have been used in special cases . at higher order , confluent and analytic correction terms ( such as temperature independent constants ) 
 are introduced . thus including the confluent correction terms , the critical behavior , @xmath27 , 
 is written in terms of the @xmath24 scaling as @xmath28 where @xmath29 with @xmath30 being the [ universal ] confluent correction exponent , and @xmath31 is the confluent correction amplitude . in the @xmath17 scaling form , 
 @xmath5 in the above equation is replaced by @xmath32 . 
 this critical scaling form is firmly established by field theory in the limit of temperatures very close to @xmath33  @xcite 
 . ratios of the @xmath31 for different observables are universal  @xcite . 
 the exponent @xmath34 is common in both scaling forms so long as @xmath35 . 
 however , no general argument seems to have been given which would show that either the @xmath17 or the @xmath24 scaling is optimal for all ( or any ) observables when a much wider temperature range is considered . 
 recently we have proposed an extended scaling scheme for normalizing observables such that the leading critical expressions remain good approximations right up to the trivial fixed point at infinite temperature  @xcite . 
 our extended scaling scheme is based on a consideration of high - temperature series expansions ( htse ) , and so is naturally formulated in terms of the @xmath24 scaling . 
 the most important ingredient of the scheme is the introduction of non - critical prefactors @xmath36 in the normalizations , where each exponent @xmath37 is uniquely chosen such that the normalized @xmath38 tends to the correct asymptotic form in the limit @xmath39 .    in the present work our aim is to further develop our extended scaling scheme to include explicitly the confluent and analytical correction terms . 
 we then validate our scheme by analyzing data for three canonical ferromagnets : the @xmath40 ising , xy and heisenberg models on simple cubic lattices in dimension three . 
 these models have been intensively studied over many years and their main critical parameters : @xmath0 , the critical exponents @xmath16 , @xmath34 , and certain critical amplitudes are known to high precision . 
 careful accounts of studies using different complementary approaches are given for instance in refs . 
 accurate simulation and htse results have been published in the form of tabulated data . 
 the present analyses show that the appropriately normalized leading terms are good approximations over the entire temperature range , with small but identifiable corrections due to confluent and non - critical terms . 
 we obtain estimates of non - universal critical parameters like critical amplitudes @xmath41 and confluent correction amplitudes @xmath42 from the high precision numerical data . 
 our extended scaling analyses are in each case entirely consistent with field theoretical and htse estimates of the critical parameters . 
 an important result of the present analysis is to demonstrate that the prefactors @xmath36 which have been introduced play a crucial role in extracting accurate values of the critical exponents from simulation data even in a temperature range close to @xmath0 , such as @xmath43 . in the standard scalings without the prefactors 
 the estimates of the leading critical term and of the confluent term from analyses of numerical data turn out to be modified to order @xmath44 ( note @xmath45 ) 
 .    the same approach based on the htse should be directly applicable to a wide class of systems having the same intrinsic htse structure as the simple ferromagnets . 
 extensions to more complex systems such as spin glasses are in principle straightforward  @xcite . 
 the paper is organized as follows . in sec . 
 [ sec : basics ] we explain our extended scaling scheme for various thermodynamic observables , and discuss confluent corrections to scaling terms in our scheme . in sec . 
 [ sec : analysis ] we give methods of analysis for numerical data using our extended scaling scheme . 
 we show how they work in practice for ising , xy and heisenberg ferromagnets in sec . 
 [ sec:3dising ] , [ sec:3dxy ] and [ sec:3dh ] , respectively . in sec . 
 [ sec : conclusion ] we make concluding remarks and discuss related problems . 
 let us suppose htse of an observable @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 the most important ingredient of our extended scaling scheme is then to write @xmath27 as @xmath48 where @xmath49 with @xmath50 . in particular , the leading contribution without the confluent correction is represented as @xmath51 the idea here is to let @xmath27 not only represent the correct power - law divergence @xmath52 with the critical amplitude @xmath53 ( and with certain confluent correction terms ) at temperatures close to @xmath0 but also have an asymptotic form consistent with the htse in the high temperature limit . 
 the observable @xmath46 is then approximated as @xmath54 here the second term represents the analytic ( non - critical ) correction term in the present scheme . 
 its coefficients @xmath55 and @xmath56 are determined in such a way that eq . 
 ( [ f_expression ] ) , combined with eqs . 
 ( [ fc_expression ] ) and ( [ rfc_expression ] ) , coincides with eq . 
 ( [ hight_expression ] ) termwise as a function of @xmath24 ; for example , @xmath57 and a similar expression for @xmath58 . the above set of equations with the minimum number of the confluent and analytic correction terms is an optimized expression we propose for the function @xmath46 which is analytic in the range @xmath59 and is singular at @xmath60 . 
 an important quantity for analyzing our extended scaling scheme is @xmath61 defined by @xmath62 it is the ratio of the measured values of observable @xmath14 to its leading critical term including the @xmath36 prefactor but without the critical amplitude @xmath41 . 
 explicitly , in the vicinity of @xmath0 where @xmath63 , it behaves as @xmath64 the plot @xmath61 versus @xmath65 near @xmath66 thus becomes a straight line with intercept @xmath67 and slope @xmath68 , where the values of @xmath0 , @xmath16 and @xmath34 are assumed to be known ( @xmath37 and @xmath69 are given by htse analysis ) . in the limit @xmath70 , on the other hand , it becomes @xmath71 between these limits the form of @xmath61 will depend on the entire collection of unspecified higher order corrections to scaling . 
 the `` true '' susceptibility , naturally defined through the magnetization response to an infinitesimal applied field , is given by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem as @xmath72 the reduced susceptibility @xmath73 is ( confusingly ) almost always referred to in the literature as `` the susceptibility '' . for consistency we will follow this convention and write the reduced susceptibility as @xmath74 , but we will refer systematically in the text to `` reduced susceptibility '' . 
 the htse for the reduced susceptibility @xmath75 in @xmath40 ferromagnets is of the form with @xmath76 and @xmath77 , or with abbreviation of @xmath78 , @xmath79 then the leading divergent expression , eq . 
 ( [ fc_leading ] ) , is written as @xmath80 with @xmath81 . 
 the ratio @xmath82 of eq . 
 ( [ rf_expression ] ) is reduced to @xmath83 where @xmath84 is eq . 
 ( [ fc_expression ] ) for @xmath8 . 
 note that @xmath85 at @xmath0 , @xmath86 near @xmath33 , and @xmath87 near infinite temperature . if @xmath82 remains close to 1 over the whole temperature range ( which is the case for the systems we consider as we will see below ) , the leading critical contribution without the correction terms , @xmath88 , is a good approximation for the reduced susceptibility , @xmath75 . 
 furthermore , the small difference @xmath89 of the ising and xy ferromagnets in the whole temperature range @xmath59 turns out to be reproduced surprisingly well by our optimized expression , @xmath90 of eq . 
 ( [ f_expression ] ) , only with one confluent and two non - critical correction terms . 
 there are different alternative definitions for the correlation length , but any correlation length diverges at criticality as @xmath91 . 
 the second moment correlation length @xmath92 is defined through the second moment @xmath93 with @xmath94 the space dimensionality @xcite . from now on we will refer to @xmath95 simply as @xmath96 . 
 the htse results show that for @xmath97-vector @xmath40 spins , the series for @xmath98 is of the form @xmath99 and is well behaved with @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the number of nearest neighbors . 
 this yields @xmath102 and @xmath103 . 
 we then reduce eq . 
 ( [ fc_leading ] ) to @xmath104 where @xmath105 with @xmath106 being the standard critical amplitude in eq .  ( [ beta_scaling ] ) for @xmath107 . 
 the non - standard normalization prefactor @xmath108 for @xmath109 is our main result . 
 the mean - field calculation  @xcite of the correlation length through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem provides an example confirming the extended scaling form of eq . 
 ( [ cri_xi ] ) . 
 see also the analysis of fisher and burford @xcite , particularly their temperature dependent `` effective interaction range '' parameter @xmath110 . 
 the critically divergent part of @xmath96 with the confluent correction terms is represented by @xmath111 and is written as @xmath112 the ratio @xmath113 becomes @xmath114 again , because of the confluent correction , it becomes @xmath115 near @xmath33 and @xmath116\beta + \cdots$ ] with @xmath117 being the coefficient in eq . 
 ( [ htse_chi ] ) near infinite temperature .      the usual analysis of the specific heat ( defined as the derivative of the internal energy at fixed volume @xmath118 ) near criticality assumes the form @xmath119^{-\alpha } + k \label{standard_c}\ ] ] where @xmath120 and @xmath121 is the critical amplitude of @xmath122 , and it is standard practice to introduce a large non - critical ( in fact temperature independent ) contribution @xmath123 ( see e.g. ref  [ ] ) . 
 while the series for the reduced susceptibility and the second moment @xmath124 are polynomial functions of @xmath24 with both odd and even terms , for bipartite ( such as bcc and simple cubic ) lattices the htse expression for @xmath125 consists of even powers of @xmath24 only  @xcite , and can be written as @xmath126 one can carry through the same type of argument  @xcite as in the case of @xmath127 , except that as all the terms in the series are even in @xmath128 , the critical behavior must be re - written in terms of the scaling variable @xmath129 $ ] replacing @xmath130 $ ] in the equivalent expressions for the correlation length . 
 thus , with @xmath131 , one can write the leading critical term , which corresponds to eq . 
 ( [ fc_leading ] ) , as @xmath132 where @xmath133 . 
 if the confluent correction terms are included , we obtain the expression corresponding to eq . 
 ( [ fc_expression ] ) as @xmath134 . \label{c_cri}\ ] ] where @xmath135 is the confluent correction amplitude . 
 it is noted that , since the two critical amplitudes @xmath121 and @xmath136 are introduced in the standard way ( as represented by eq . 
 ( [ standard_c ] ) for @xmath121 ) , the factors @xmath137 and @xmath138 appear in the definition of @xmath139 and in eq . 
 ( [ c_cri ] ) , respectively . 
 in fact there is a hyper - universal relationship linking this @xmath140 to @xmath106  @xcite : @xmath141 where @xmath142 is a constant whose value is known rather accurately  @xcite . 
 equation ( [ cri_c ] ) is not standard , but it can be seen to tend to the appropriate limit , @xmath143 , as @xmath17 approaches @xmath0 .    in practice 
 @xmath139 is much larger than unity ( as will be seen later in the case of the @xmath144 ising model ) which is the reason for the large non - critical contribution to @xmath125 . 
 the non - critical contribution is in fact not a parameter to be adjusted freely , but it has to be determined through the high temperature limit of an equation which corresponds to eq . 
 ( [ f_expression ] ) . ignoring the confluent correction so as to clarify the discussion , we know the exact high temperature limits for @xmath145 from eq . 
 ( [ cri_c ] ) and for @xmath125 by eq . 
 ( [ htse_c ] ) . 
 then @xmath125 truncated to two leading non - critical correction terms is explicitly written as @xmath146 where the non - critical parameters @xmath147 are given by @xmath148 and @xmath149 . 
 the coefficients @xmath150 and @xmath151 are known from htse . 
 so if @xmath152 and @xmath153 have been measured independently , we can evaluate all the parameters which one needs to fix the functional form of @xmath125 , such as @xmath154 and @xmath139 determined through eq . 
 ( [ eqn : hyper ] ) . 
 this we assume to be @xmath155 , an optimized expression for @xmath125 , in the whole @xmath24 range @xmath156 . 
 the thus calculated curve @xmath155 can be tested by comparing with simulation and htse data .      though we will discuss thermodynamic limit behavior only and 
 will not analyze finite - size - scaling ( fss ) data explicitly in the present paper , we note for reference that the extended scaling normalization modifies the fss expressions . 
 the canonical fss ansatz @xcite is @xmath157 , \label{fss}\ ] ] where @xmath158 is a universal scaling function . 
 the frequently used fss expression derived from eq . 
 ( [ fss ] ) , @xmath159\ ] ] contains the implicit assumption of @xmath17 scaling for the correlation length . 
 it is thus only appropriate if restricted to a very narrow range of temperature around @xmath33 . with the extended scaling and the finite size correlation length @xmath160 
 , the fss ansatz can be rewritten @xcite @xmath161 , \label{fss_ferro}\ ] ] or @xmath162,\ ] ] where the scaling functions behave as @xmath163 and @xmath164 at @xmath165 . for the reduced susceptibility with @xmath76 
 , the fss form is written as @xmath166 ,   \nonumber \\ & = & \tau^{-\gamma } \tilde{\mathcal f}_{\chi }   \left[\left(\frac{l}{\beta^{1/2}}\right)^{1/\nu}\tau\right ] , \label{fss_chi}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath167 and @xmath168 constant . at @xmath165 . in a similar manner , the fss form for the correlation length @xmath160 , for which @xmath169 and @xmath102 , is written as @xmath170 ,   \label{fss_xi}\ ] ] where @xmath171 at @xmath165 . 
 while the extended fss scheme for the susceptibility is modified from the standard one only by the @xmath24-prefactor in the argument of @xmath172 , the scaling plot is significantly improved for @xmath173 ising ferromagnetic and @xmath144 ising spin glass models  @xcite . 
 in order to make a stringent test of the extended scaling scheme , we study the three canonical ferromagnets : ising , xy and heisenberg , on three dimensional simple cubic lattices . 
 high precision numerical data have been obtained for each of these systems for the temperature domain ranging from close to @xmath0 to about @xmath174 and the authors have generously published their data in tabulated form  @xcite . 
 the data have been taken on systems large enough for the data points to be representative of the thermodynamic limit . 
 long htses have also been published for @xmath74 and @xmath124 and for @xmath175 for all three systems  @xcite , and relatively longer series for the free - energy and the specific heat have been calculated for the ising model  @xcite ; these series can be used to calculate @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath122 explicitly for the region @xmath17 well above @xmath0 . 
 below we call these htse and mc data as the _ real _ data . 
 thanks to a combination of results from field theory and htse the values of the critical temperatures , the critical exponents and the critical amplitudes are known to a high degree of accuracy , and the confluent correction exponents are also well known . 
 the [ non - universal ] confluent correction amplitudes are small for these three systems and the estimates are much less accurate ( see butera and comi @xcite for a detailed account ) .    in each case we will plot the ratios @xmath82 and @xmath113 respectively defined by eqs . 
 ( [ rchi_def ] ) and ( [ rxi_def ] ) with respect to @xmath65 , where we have used @xmath176 for simple cubic lattices . 
 the plots near @xmath66 give us the critical and the confluent amplitudes as explained at the end of sec . 
 [ sec : optimal ] . 
 the ratios are defined in a way that they approach unity at infinite temperature . 
 we will see that the two ratios defined in the extended scaling scheme are in fact close to unity ( within several hundredth deviation from unity at most ) in the whole range of @xmath5 . in addition , a simple scaling relation links the observables @xmath75 and @xmath96 through @xmath177 to leading order . 
 this equation has the advantage that it can in principle be used to determine the exponent @xmath178 directly from a log - log plot of @xmath75 against @xmath96 near @xmath179 without any explicit knowledge of @xmath179 . for the extended scaling scheme ( @xmath24 scaling with the @xmath36 factors ) 
 , the relation can be rewritten to leading order @xmath180 we will analyze the ratio defined by @xmath181 including the leading confluent correction factors , it behaves near @xmath33 as @xmath182 where @xmath183 and @xmath184 . 
 we also note that the ratios @xmath185 are universal and are known to be about @xmath186  @xcite . 
 this means that @xmath187 . 
 for the @xmath144 simple cubic ising case @xmath188 , together with the high precision mc data at temperatures close to @xmath0 by kim et al@xcite and the htse estimates at relatively high temperatures by butera and comi@xcite , our own mc data are also used in order to interpolate them and to see overall temperature dependences of @xmath189 and @xmath175 . in our simulation 
 we used the exchange mc method in combination with 64 bit multi - spin coding technique for making equilibration fast . 
 the 64 different temperatures simulated are distributed in the range of @xmath190 . 
 the amount of total mc steps for @xmath191 is @xmath192 and the last @xmath193 mc steps are used for taking thermal averages . 
 figure  [ fig:3di - chixi - e ] shows the parameter free log - log plot in the extended scaling form of the reduced susceptibility @xmath74 against @xmath194 data . without allowing for corrections , 
 the slope of the line fitted to the data points ( ignoring our mc data when they are polluted by finite - size effects ) gives a first estimate @xmath195 . 
 figure [ fig:3di - chixi - c ] is the equivalent standard ( @xmath17 or @xmath24 scaling ) log - log plot of @xmath74 against @xmath107 with the slope fixed to the one obtained from fig . 
 [ fig:3di - chixi - e ] . 
 it can be seen that in the standard scaling form the linear relationship breaks down rather quickly while in the extended scaling form with the same input data , the linearity persists to a good approximation up to an infinite temperature and down to temperatures near @xmath33 until limited by finite - size effects . 
 we examine the leading correction of the extended scaling formula given by eq . 
 ( [ ratio_normalized ] ) . to higher precision , fig . 
 [ fig:3di - chixi - e2 ] shows a plot of @xmath196 against @xmath197 , assuming @xmath198 , @xmath199 and @xmath200  @xcite . 
 the line is obtained by fitting the data points at @xmath201 to eq . 
 ( [ ratio_normalized ] ) . 
 the intercept at @xmath66 , @xmath202 , is in good agreement with the value @xmath203 assuming the critical amplitudes from htse @xcite . from the initial slope , @xmath204 , which we will comment on below . 
 figures [ fig:3di - rchi ] and [ fig:3di - rxi ] show the ratios @xmath82 and @xmath113 of eqs . 
 ( [ rchi_def ] ) and ( [ rxi_def ] ) , respectively . 
 the numerical data are taken from kim et al @xcite , and the higher temperature values are calculated using the tabulated series of butera and comi@xcite . 
 the htse terms were simply summed , and the points quoted correspond to the temperature range where the contributions from further terms can be considered negligible on the scale of the plots . by using appropriate extrapolation techniques , like differential approximations , the range over which the published htse data@xcite could be used to evaluate the temperature dependence of the observables to high precision could be considerably extended . 
 the assumed critical parameters are @xmath205 , @xmath206 and @xmath207@xcite . from the initial intercepts and slopes of the fitted line at small @xmath5 
 , we obtain @xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 and @xmath211 . 
 the @xmath212 values are in excellent agreement with the htse estimates@xcite , @xmath213 and @xmath214 . 
 the @xmath42 values are in qualitative agreement with the htse estimates @xmath215 and @xmath216  @xcite .    an overall conclusion on the extended scaling analysis of the @xmath144 simple cubic ising data , which will be confirmed by the analyses of the two other systems as well , 
 is that this form of scaling is entirely consistent with the high precision values of critical parameters from extensive htse and field theoretical ( ft ) work . 
 it is remarkable that over the entire temperature range from @xmath0 to infinity , the maximum deviations from the leading critical expressions of eqs . 
 ( [ cri_chi ] ) and ( [ cri_xi ] ) are of the order of a few percent . 
 let us go into further discussions about the @xmath217 behavior . in the inset of fig . 
 [ fig:3di - rchi ] , we show the corresponding @xmath17 scaling ratio @xmath218 plotted against @xmath219 . 
 the latter is calculated using the same values of the critical parameters @xmath220 and @xmath221 as those for @xmath217 , and so by construction in the low @xmath222 limit the intercepts and slopes of both ratios must coincide . 
 it can be seen that in fact the @xmath17 scaling curve only approaches the @xmath24 scaling curve closely in the range of @xmath222 extremely close to zero . 
 this result for @xmath74 with @xmath223 strongly suggests the superiority of the @xmath24 scaling , and hence our extended scaling , over the @xmath17 scaling . 
 the full curve in the main frame of fig .  [ fig:3di - rchi ] is the optimized expression , @xmath224 , which is evaluated through @xmath225 , with one confluent correction term discussed above and the two non - critical terms . 
 the first term of the latter is a constant , @xmath226 , which yields simply @xmath227 at @xmath228 , or at an infinite temperature . 
 its second term @xmath229 , which is also calculated via the parameters already fixed , specifies the slope of @xmath224 at @xmath228 . by taking into account only these three correction terms to the leading critical term , @xmath230 of eq . 
 ( [ cri_chi ] ) , we obtain @xmath224 which reproduces surprisingly well the _ real _ data in the whole temperature range @xmath231 . 
 notice that @xmath232 corresponds to @xmath233 . 
 this result also indicates the superiority of our extended scaling with the @xmath24 scaling : @xmath230 not only represents the critical behavior of @xmath75 close to @xmath0 but also @xmath75 in the whole temperature range up to infinity . in this context 
 we note again that @xmath234 for the `` true '' susceptibility and that the reduced susceptibility @xmath75 is derived through our extended scaling scheme . 
 we also note that the similarity between the @xmath217 plot in fig . 
 [ fig:3di - rchi ] and the @xmath235 plot in fig . 
 [ fig:3di - rxi ] over the entire range of temperature is striking . 
 lastly , fig . 
 [ fig:3di - spec ] shows @xmath236 as a function of @xmath237 . 
 the data points are calculated from the htse of arisue and fujiwara which extends to powers up to @xmath238  @xcite , mc energy data at @xmath239 and @xmath240  @xcite , and our numerical simulations for different sizes up to @xmath191 . 
 we examine the extended scaling with non - critical contributions to @xmath125 given by eq . 
 ( [ c_beta ] ) . by using the hyper - universal relation with the value of @xmath142 equal to @xmath241  @xcite for the @xmath144 ising model and our @xmath107 analysis 
 , we obtain @xmath242 
 . then the non - critical parameters @xmath243 and @xmath244 are determined by @xmath150 and @xmath151 of htse and with putting @xmath245 . 
 the solid curve represents the no - free parameter plot of eq . 
 ( [ c_beta ] ) with the @xmath246 values cited or estimated above . 
 the agreement over the whole temperature range is very satisfactory ; the non - critical correction is so strong that the bare leading power law is a poor approximation until very much closer to @xmath0 than the range covered by the figure . 
 we consider this result as an indication that the extended scaling scheme combined with the optimized introduction of correction terms is an effective method for analyzing critically - divergent quantities in general . 
 the same analysis has been carried out for the @xmath144 xy model ( @xmath247 ) . 
 high precision numerical data were published by gottlob and hasenbusch@xcite , and are supplemented here by unpublished data kindly provided by m.  hasebusch@xcite . 
 the higher temperature data are calculated using the tabulated series of butera and comi@xcite . 
 the critical point is @xmath248 and the exponents @xmath178 , @xmath34 , @xmath249 and @xmath250 are close to @xmath251 and @xmath252 , respectively@xcite . 
 figure  [ fig:3dxy - chixi - e ] shows the @xmath253 log - log plot . 
 the leading scaling scheme works well up to very high temperatures , as in the ising case . the slope in fig . 
 [ fig:3dxy - chixi - e ] gives us the value of @xmath178 which is in agreement with the previously reported values@xcite . 
 figure [ fig:3dxy - chixi - e2 ] shows the plot of @xmath254^{2-\eta}$ ] against @xmath65 assuming the central values for the exponents @xmath178 and @xmath34 as mentioned above . 
 figures [ fig:3dxy - rchi ] and [ fig:3dxy - rxi ] show @xmath82 and @xmath113 respectively against @xmath197 . from the @xmath66 
 intercept and the initial slope one can estimate @xmath255 , @xmath256 , @xmath257 and @xmath258 . 
 these are all reasonably close to the quite independent htse values@xcite @xmath259 , @xmath260 , @xmath261 and @xmath262 , but are probably more reliable as they are consistent with the independent ft estimate of the universal ratio @xmath263 , see comments in ref . 
 [ ] . also , the values of @xmath264 and @xmath265 in eq . 
 ( [ ratio_normalized ] ) calculated from thus obtained set of the parameters reproduce well the data as shown in fig . 
 [ fig:3dxy - chixi - e2 ] . 
 this agreement again validates the extended scaling protocol and demonstrates that a combination of information from ft , htse , and simulations analyzed using this protocol can lead to consistent high precision critical parameter measurements .    for comparison , we plot the standard @xmath17 scaling ratio @xmath266 introduced in sec .  [ sec:3dising ] also in fig . 
 [ fig:3dxy - rchi ] . 
 its coincidence with @xmath217 will only hold for @xmath267 . as is the case for the ising system , 
 the slope of @xmath268 is opposite to that of @xmath82 and the magnitude of @xmath269 is much larger than the corresponding magnitude of the extended ratio already at @xmath270 , or @xmath271 . in fig . 
 [ fig:3dxy - rxi ] , we also show the @xmath17 scaling @xmath272 and the @xmath273 by @xmath24-scaling . 
 the true leading term plus confluent correction holds with the extended scaling form , @xmath235 of eq . 
 ( [ rxi_def ] ) with @xmath247 up to @xmath274 while with the other forms of scaling the correct limit will hold only for @xmath267 . 
 in particular , the comparison of @xmath24 scaling @xmath275 with extended scaling @xmath235 demonstrates the importance of the @xmath108 prefactor in eq . 
 ( [ rxi_def ] ) of the extended scaling scheme . 
 these results imply that even close to @xmath0 the extended scaling is a considerable improvement over the standard scaling analysis for estimating critical parameters including the correction terms . 
 the curve in fig . 
 [ fig:3dxy - rchi ] represents our optimized estimates @xmath224 up to the second order of non - critical corrections . 
 it reproduces about 5 percents change in @xmath217 , from about 1.05 at @xmath66 to 1 at @xmath228 , to a very good approximation . 
 the corresponding relative change in @xmath235 is only less than 2 percents as seen in fig . 
 [ fig:3dxy - rxi ] . to reproduce this change by @xmath276 to an approximation as good as @xmath224 in fig . 
 [ fig:3dxy - rchi ] , however , more than third order non - critical correction terms are required . 
 the same analysis has been carried out for the @xmath144 heisenberg model ( @xmath277 ) . 
 high precision numerical data were published by holm and janke@xcite , and are supplemented here by higher temperature data calculated using the tabulated series of butera and comi@xcite . 
 the critical point is @xmath278 and the exponents @xmath178 and @xmath34 are close to @xmath279 and @xmath280  @xcite . 
 a recent exponent set @xcite gives @xmath281 , @xmath282 and @xmath283 . 
 figure  [ fig:3dh - chixi - e ] shows the @xmath284 log - log plot , which gives an estimate of @xmath178 consistent with that of ref .  [ ] . 
 figure  [ fig:3dh - chixi - e2 ] shows the plot of @xmath285^{2-\eta}$ ] against @xmath197 assuming the exponent values as @xmath286 and @xmath287 . from this plot 
 it appears that the initial slope is very small , corresponding to almost zero values for @xmath288 and @xmath289 . 
 figures [ fig:3dh - rchi ] and [ fig:3dh - rxi ] show respectively @xmath82 and @xmath113 against @xmath197 , assuming the values of @xmath249 and @xmath250 in ref .  [ ] . 
 the mc and htse points may not appear to connect smoothly in these figures , because the manner in which the plots are presented enhances small deviations from the leading term form . 
 however , the change in the values of both @xmath82 in fig . 
 [ fig:3dh - rchi ] and @xmath113 in fig . 
 [ fig:3dh - rxi ] are limited to within a few percent of their absolute magnitude in a whole range of @xmath5 as is the case for the other two ferromagnets studied . from the straight line fit of the mc data at small @xmath197 , one can estimate @xmath290 , @xmath291 , @xmath292 and @xmath293 . in this case 
 the parameters are slightly less consistent with the htse estimates@xcite , @xmath294 , @xmath295 , @xmath296 and @xmath297 , but it should be noted that the estimates for these [ non - universal ] parameters depend very sensitively on the precise values taken for the critical exponents . 
 we certainly need more precise data near @xmath0 to fix the values of these critical parameters for the heisenberg ferromagnet . 
 we have outlined a systematic rule for the scaling and normalization of thermodynamic observables having critical behavior at continuous phase transitions . 
 this `` extended scaling '' rule corresponds for ferromagnets to scaling of the leading term of the reduced susceptibility above @xmath0 as @xmath298 in agreement with standard practice , for the leading term of the second moment correlation length as @xmath299 with @xmath300 and for the leading term of the specific heat in bipartite lattices @xmath301 with @xmath133 plus strong non - critical correction terms which we explicitly evaluate by linking to the htse . 
 analyses are made of high precision numerical data on three canonical ferromagnets using these expressions allowing for confluent scaling correction terms , plus non - critical corrections for the specific heat . 
 near @xmath0 the results are entirely consistent with the critical parameter sets ( including the confluent corrections ) which have been obtained independently using sophisticated ft , htse and simulation techniques@xcite . 
 the most important result found in the present work is that , for @xmath8 and @xmath9 the leading critical expressions with the extended scaling normalizations @xmath302 of eq . 
 ( [ fc_leading ] ) agree to a very good approximation with the true @xmath46 up to infinite temperature . 
 to demonstrate this fact more in details we have introduced the ratio @xmath61 defined by eq . 
 ( [ rf_expression ] ) . for @xmath74 of the ising ferromagnet , for example , it is equal to the critical amplitude @xmath303 at @xmath0 ( @xmath66 ) and to unity at infinite temperature ( @xmath228 ) by definition . 
 @xmath217 evaluated from the true data are represented by the data points in fig . 
 [ fig:3di - rchi ] , while @xmath217 evaluated through the leading expression @xmath304 is independent of @xmath5 and equal to @xmath303 . 
 the difference between the two is , however , at most 13 percent in this case . 
 the corresponding differences for @xmath217 s of the two other ferromagnets as well as for @xmath235 s of the all three ferromagnets are less than several percent . 
 this is our first result mentioned just above . 
 we have next demonstrated that our extended scaling scheme , in terms of the @xmath24 scaling and with the temperature dependent prefactor @xmath36 , is of crucial importance in precisely extracting the small amplitude @xmath42 of the leading confluent correction term . 
 the result is represented by the solid line in fig . 
 [ fig:3di - rchi ] as well as those in figs . 
 [ fig:3di - rxi ] , [ fig:3dxy - rchi ] , and [ fig:3dxy - rxi ] . 
 in addition , we have also checked that the optimized expression @xmath305 of eq . 
 ( [ f_expression ] ) , consisting of @xmath306 and one confluent and two non - critical correction , yield @xmath307 which reproduces the true @xmath61 surprisingly well as shown the curves in figs . 
 [ fig:3di - rchi ] and [ fig:3dxy - rchi ] , though more than third non - critical correction terms would be required for equally good agreement in other observables . 
 the large non - critical terms in the specific heat @xmath122 are also incorporated explicitly within our extended scaling scheme with no further adjustable input parameters . for the ising ferromagnet on the simple cubic lattice @xmath122 
 is calculated to a good approximation over the entire temperature range ( see eq . 
 ( [ c_beta ] ) ) . 
 although the non - critical correction terms are large for @xmath122 , the principle of the analysis is the same as the one applied above to @xmath8 and @xmath9 , for which the corrections to scaling are quite small . 
 namely , each critically - divergent observable @xmath46 is represented by @xmath305 of eq . 
 ( [ f_expression ] ) over the whole range of @xmath24 to a good approximation . 
 the input consists of @xmath308 , a confluent correction term and a very limited numbers of non - critical correction terms derived from htse . 
 together these results can be taken as validating the `` extended scaling '' approach . 
 the approach could be systematically implemented in numerical work so as to improve yet further the accuracy of critical parameter sets derived for standard systems , possibly incorporating where necessary further higher order correction terms . 
 perhaps a more fruitful application would concern the analyses of numerical data in more complex systems , where the present accuracy of the critical parameter sets is much poorer . 
 for instance , it has been pointed out that for the analysis of data on spin glasses with symmetric interaction distributions @xmath24 should be replaced by @xmath309 in all expressions@xcite as all terms in the htse in these spin glasses are strictly even in @xmath24 . the extended scaling protocol allowing for this and with appropriate @xmath310 normalization factors 
 has indeed been shown to significantly improve the consistency of critical exponent values derived from numerical simulations on ising spin glasses@xcite .

 must be introduced. 
 the simplest and most traditional convention, which will be referred to below as @xmath17 scaling, is to normalize each @xmath18 by a temperature independent constant. for obvious reasons this constant 
 is chosen to be @xmath19 for each observable ; one then writes the normalized leading term as the familiar text - book expression : @xmath20^{-\rho_f } = { \cal   c}_{f}t^{-\rho_f }, \label{t_scaling}\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the critical amplitude ( see  [ ] for a detailed review ). 
 an alternative and _ a priori _ equally valid choice is to write @xmath23^{-\rho_f } = { \cal c}_{f}[(t-\tc)/t]^{-\rho_f}\nonumber \\ & = & { \cal c}_{f}\left[1-\frac{\beta}{\bec}\right]^{-\rho_f } = { \cal c}_{f}\tau^{-\rho_f }, \label{beta_scaling}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the inverse temperature @xmath25 and @xmath26. 
 note that the temperature dependence of the normalization is now different for each observable. 
 this `` @xmath24 scaling '' form has become the standard normalization for theoretical work on the critical properties of ferromagnets and analogous systems, see for instance  @xcite, although more complex normalizations have been used in special cases. at higher order, confluent and analytic correction terms ( such as temperature independent constants ) 
 are introduced. thus including the confluent correction terms, the critical behavior, @xmath27, 
 is written in terms of the @xmath24 scaling as @xmath28 where @xmath29 with @xmath30 being the [ universal ] confluent correction exponent, and @xmath31 is the confluent correction amplitude. in the @xmath17 scaling form, 
 @xmath5 in the above equation is replaced by @xmath32. 
 this critical scaling form, @xmath17 scaling, has been widely used in the analysis of numerical data. 
 however, it has been pointed out in the literature  @xcite that this form may not be the best choice for the analysis of numerical data. 
 this criticism is based on the fact that the @xmath17 scaling form does not take into account the temperature dependence of the normalization constant, @xmath33, for each observable. 
 the normalization constant, @xmath33, is temperature independent, i.e., @xmath34, where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the critical temperature. 
 this","Fluency: 3 - The summary is mostly readable and grammatically correct, but it contains some awkward phrasing and incomplete sentences (e.g., ""this criticism is based on the fact that the @xmath17 scaling form does not take into account the temperature dependence of the normalization constant, @xmath33, for each observable.""). The use of placeholders like @xmath33 also disrupts readability.

Factuality: 4 - The summary accurately reflects the source material, including the discussion of @xmath17 and @xmath24 scaling, critical exponents, and normalization factors. However, it introduces a minor inaccuracy by stating ""@xmath17 scaling has been widely used in the analysis of numerical data"" without explicitly linking this to the source's context.

Coverage: 3 - The summary covers the main problem (scaling conventions) and methods (@xmath17 and @xmath24 scaling), but it misses key findings, such as the proposed extended scaling scheme and its validation using ferromagnets. The summary also ends abruptly, omitting the conclusion or broader implications."

 magnetization data have been recorded using a quantum design mpms xl squid magnetometer , equipped with a reciprocating sample option . 
 a polycrystalline sample of rbfe@xmath0as@xmath0 was studied for its low temperature magnetic properties . in fig . 
 1 the magnetic moment in the field - cooled state ( fc ) and in the zero - field cooled state ( zfc ) in a magnetic field of 1 mt are shown . 
 the data are indicative of bulk superconductivity . 
 the distinct onset of diamagnetism due to superconductivity is observed at @xmath11 k. due to the limited temperature range of the equipment , the full development of the meissner state could not be recorded . 
 nevertheless , the observed zfc diamagnetic response mirrors bulk superconductivity and is consistent with the sample dimensions . the pronounced difference between the zfc and fc curves stemms from remarkable flux - pinning in the sample , suggesting rather high critical current density . 
 + the upper critical field @xmath15 was estimated from magnetization measurements performed at various magnetic fields in the mixed state . in fig . 2 , 
 two representative measurements of the magnetic moment versus temperature are displayed for @xmath16 mt and for @xmath17 mt . we defined the upper critical field @xmath15 as the magnetic field @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is located . 
 an obvious shift of the onset of superconductivity of 0.15 k is observed between the respective fields . 
 in addition to the diamagnetic signal due to superconductivity , a distinct paramagnetic response develops due to the normal state magnetic contribution , rendering an accurate determination of @xmath2 rather difficult . nevertheless , 
 since a clear downward curvature is observed due to the onset of superconducting diamagnetism , the trend of @xmath2 can be followed down to 2 k. figure 3 shows a summary of the results up to a field of 0.8 t , anticipating a linear slope close to @xmath8 of @xmath3 t / k . assuming a simple whh temperature dependence @xcite , which is known not to be applicable for the fe pnictide superconductors with much higher transition temperatures 
 , one would extrapolate @xmath4 t , in comparision to the lower critical field @xmath20 mt , as we estimated from field dependent initial magnetization curves , and the thermodynamic critical field @xmath21 mt . 
 superconductivity is , obviously , of type ii . 
 + the solid solution ( rb , ba)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 offers a particularly simple example where the interrelation between magnetic and superconducting ground states in the fe pnictides can be studied through the controlled shift of the fermi level . 
 bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 shows antiferromagnetic ordering competing with superconducting state . 
 appearently , doping of rbfe@xmath0as@xmath0 with ba leads to a natural picture of enhancing @xmath8 in the superconducting state , as the charge carrier concentration is varied . 
 the appearence of superconductivity in rbfe@xmath0as@xmath0 opens up the window for a new interpretation of the occurence of superconducting state in ( rb , ba)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 @xcite .     for rbfe@xmath0as@xmath0 . 
 the estimate of @xmath4 t is made using the whh - approach . ] 
 superconductivity is observed in undoped rbfe@xmath0as@xmath0 with a @xmath11 k. in this sense , it is useful to consider rbfe@xmath0as@xmath0 as a superconductor , located at the opposite end to the nonsuperconducting compound bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 in the ( rb , ba)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 system 
 . therefore , superconductivity is enhanced by doping of an initially superconducting nonmagnetic parent compound . 
 the upper critical field at zero temperature of rbfe@xmath0as@xmath0 is estimated to be @xmath4 t.

 the superconductivity of rbfe@xmath0as@xmath0 was investigated","Fluency: 3 - The summary is mostly readable and grammatically correct, but it contains some awkward phrasing and incomplete sentences (e.g., ""as@xmath0 polycrystalline sample, measured in a magnetic field of 1 mt. superconductivity sets in at @xmath11 k.]""). The use of placeholders like ""@xmath0"" and ""@xmath11"" also disrupts readability.  

Factuality: 4 - The summary accurately reflects the source material, including details about superconductivity in iron oxyarsenides, the synthesis of rbfe@xmath0as@xmath0, and its properties. However, it includes an unsupported claim about the crystal structure being confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (not mentioned in the input), which slightly detracts from factuality.  

Coverage: 4 - The summary covers the main problem (superconductivity in rbfe@xmath0as@xmath0), the method (two-step synthesis), and key findings (onset of superconductivity at 11 K, magnetic properties). However, it misses some finer details like the upper critical field estimation and the paramagnetic response in the normal state, which are important in the input."
"in this paper , we present a formal analysis of electromagnetic ( em ) radiative corrections to @xmath0 transitions .. see however ref . 
 @xcite ] only em corrections to the dominant octet nonleptonic hamiltonian are considered . 
 such corrections modify not only the original @xmath3 amplitude but also induce @xmath4 contributions as well . by the standards of particle physics , 
 this subject is very old  @xcite . yet 
 , there exists in the literature no satisfactory theoretical treatment . 
 this is due largely to complications of the strong interactions at low energy . 
 fortunately , the modern machinary of the standard model , especially the method of chiral lagrangians , provides the means to perform an analysis which is both correct and structurally complete . 
 that doing so requires no fewer than _ eight _ distinct chiral langrangians is an indication of the complexity of the undertaking . 
 there is , however , a problem with the usual chiral lagrangian methodology . the cost of implementing its calculational scheme is the introduction of many unknown constants , the finite counterterms associated with the regularization of divergent contributions . 
 as regards em corrections to nonleptonic kaon decay , it is impractical to presume that these many unknowns will be inferred phenomenologically in the reasonably near future , or perhaps ever . as a consequence , in order to obtain an acceptable phenomenological description , it will be necessary to proceed beyond the confines of strict chiral perturbation theory . in a previous publication  @xcite 
 , we succeeded in accomplishing this task in a limited context , @xmath5 decay in the chiral limit . 
 we shall extend this work to a full phenomenological treatment of the @xmath0 decays in the next paper  @xcite of this series . 
 the proper formal analysis , which is the subject of this paper , begins in sect .  2 where we briefly describe the construction of @xmath6 decay amplitudes in the presence of electromagnetic corrections . 
 in section 3 , we begin to implement the chiral program by specifying the collection of strong and electroweak chiral lagrangians which bear on our analysis . 
 the calculation of @xmath6 decay amplitudes is covered in section 4 and our concluding remarks appear in section 5 
 .    .1 cm 0.2 cm 
 there are three physical @xmath6 decay amplitudes , is defined via @xmath7 . ] 
 _ k^0 ^+ ^- _ + -  , _ k^0 ^0 ^0 _ 00  , _ 
 k^+ ^+ ^0 _ + 0  . 
 [ a0 ] we consider first these amplitudes in the limit of exact isospin symmetry and then identify which modifications must occur in the presence of electromagnetism .    in the @xmath8 two - pion isospin basis 
 , it follows from the unitarity constraint that _ + -  & = &   a_0 e^i _ 0 + a_2 e^i _ 2  , + a_00  & = &  a_0 e^i _ 0 - a_2 e^i _ 2  , [ a1 ] + a_+0  & = &  3 2 a_2 e^i _ 2  . 
 the phases @xmath9 and @xmath10 are just the @xmath8 pion - pion scattering phase shifts ( watson s theorem ) , and in a cp - invariant world the moduli @xmath11 and @xmath12 are real - valued . the large ratio @xmath13 is associated with the @xmath3 rule .    when electromagnetism is turned on , 
 several new features appear :    1 . 
 charged external legs experience mass shifts ( _ cf _ fig . 
 [ fig : f1](a ) ) . 
 photon emission ( _ cf _ fig .  [ fig : f1](b ) ) occurs off charged external legs . 
 this effect is crucial to the cancelation of infrared singularities . 
 final state coulomb rescattering ( _ cf _ fig . 
 [ fig : f1](c ) ) occurs in @xmath14 . 
 4 .   there are structure - dependent hadronic effects , hidden in fig .  1 within the large dark vertices . 
 in this paper , we consider the leading contributions ( see fig . 
 [ fig : f2 ] ) which arise from corrections to the @xmath3 hamiltonian . 
 there will be modifications of the isospin symmetric unitarity relations and thus extensions of watson s theorem . 
 any successful explanation of em corrections to @xmath6 decays must account for all these items . 
 an analysis  @xcite of the unitarity constraint which allows for the presence of electromagnetism yields _ + - & = & ( a_0 + a_0^em ) e^i(_0 + _ 0 ) + 1 ( a_2 + a_2^em ) e^i(_2 + _ 2 )  , + a_00 & = & ( a_0 + a_0^em ) e^i(_0 + _ 0 ) - ( a_2 + a_2^em ) e^i(_2 + _ 2 )  , [ a6 ] + a_+0 & = & 3 2 ( a_2 + a_2^+em ) e^i ( _ 2 + _ 
 2 )  , to be compared with the isospin invariant expressions in eq .  ( [ a1 ] ) . 
 this parameterization holds for the ir - finite amplitudes , whose proper definition is discussed later in sect .  4.3 . 
 observe that the shifts @xmath15 and @xmath16 in @xmath17 are distinct from the corresponding shifts in @xmath18 and @xmath19 . 
 this is a consequence of a @xmath20 component induced by electromagnetism . in particular 
 , the @xmath20 signal can be recovered via _ 
 5/2 = 5  . 
 [ a6f ]    .1 cm 2.8 cm 
 the preceding section has dealt with aspects of the @xmath6 decays which are free of hadronic complexities . in this section and 
 the next , we use chiral methods to address these structure - dependent contributions . 
 the implementation of chiral symmetry via the use of chiral lagrangians provides a logically consistent framework for carrying out a perturbative analysis .    in chiral perturbation theory , 
 the perturbative quantities of smallness are the momentum scale @xmath21 and the mass scale @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the quark mass matrix . 
 in addition , we work to first order in the electromagnetic fine structure constant @xmath24 , _ 
 i = a_i^(0 ) + _ i^(1 ) +   . 
 [ c1 ] our goal is to determine the @xmath25 components @xmath26 . 
 the fine structure constant thus represents a second perturbative parameter , and we consider contributions of chiral orders @xmath27 and @xmath28 , _ 
 i^(1 )  a_i^(e^2 p^0 ) + a_i^(e^2 p^2 )  . 
 [ c1a ]    we shall restrict our attention to just the leading electromagnetic corrections to the @xmath6 amplitudes . since the weak @xmath29 amplitude is very much larger than the @xmath30 amplitude , our approach is to consider only electromagnetic corrections to @xmath29 amplitudes . as a class 
 these arise via processes contained in fig . 
 [ fig : f2 ] , where @xmath31 is the octet weak coupling defined below in eq . 
 ( [ c6 ] ) . 
 we adopt standard usage in our chiral analysis , taking the matrix @xmath32 of light pseudoscalar fields and its covariant derivative @xmath33 as u ( i _ k _ k /f _ ) 
 ( k = 1,  ,8 )  , d_u _ u + i e [ q , u ] a _  , [ c2 ] where @xmath34 is the quark charge matrix and @xmath35 is the photon field . 
 the remainder of this section summarizes the eight distinct effective lagrangians ( strong , electromagnetic , weak and electroweak ) needed in the analysis .      in the @xmath36 sector 
 , we shall employ the strong / electromagnetic lagrangian ^(2)_str = f^2_04 ( d_u d^u^ ) + f^2_04 ( u^+ u^ )  , [ c3 ] where @xmath37 is the pseudoscalar meson decay constant in lowest order . 
 @xmath38 will be used to produce @xmath39 and @xmath40 vertices in our calculation . 
 the lagrangian @xmath38 will generate ( via tadpole diagrams ) strong self - energy effects on the external legs in the @xmath0 transitions . in order to regularize these divergent contributions , 
 one employs the lagrangian  @xcite @xmath41 . 
 it is not necessary to write out this well - known set of operators , but simply to point out that the resulting wave function renormalization factors @xmath42 and @xmath43 obey  =  z _ 
 f^3  , [ c3a ] up to logarithms . 
 this explains the presence of @xmath44 in formulae such as eqs . 
 ( [ d7]),([d8 ] ) in section 4 . 
 two other nonweak effective lagrangians enter the calculation . 
 the first is associated with electromagnetic effects at chiral order @xmath27 , _ 
 ems^(0 ) = g_ems ( q u q u^ )  , [ c4 ] where the coupling @xmath45 is fixed ( in lowest chiral order ) from the pion electromagnetic mass splitting , g_ems = f_^2 2   m_^2  . 
 [ c5 ] the second extends the description to chiral order @xmath28 . 
 we need only the following subset of the lagrangian given in ref . 
 @xcite , & & l_ems^(2 ) = f^2 e^2  . 
 although the finite parts of the coefficients @xmath46 remain unconstrained , see however refs . 
 @xcite for model determinations . 
 the @xmath47 octet lagrangian begins at chiral order @xmath21 , _ 
 8^(2 )  =  g_8 ( _ 6 d_u d^u^ )  , [ c6 ] with @xmath48 fit  @xcite from @xmath0 decay rates . 
 we use this to generate @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath27 vertices . 
 two chiral lagrangians will serve to provide counterterms for removing divergent contributions . 
 the first  @xcite is the octet @xmath47 lagrangian at chiral order @xmath49 , _ 
 8^(4 ) & = & n_5 _ 6 + & + & n_6 _ 6 u _ 
 u^ ( ^^u - ^u^ ) + & + & n_7 _ 6 ( u ^+ u^ ) _ u ^u^ + & + & n_8 _ 6 _ u ^u^ ( u^+ ^u ) + & + & n_9 _ 6 + & + & n_10 _ 6 ( u ^u ^ + u^u^+ u ^u^ ) + & + & n_11 _ 6 ( u ^+ u^ ) ( u^+ ^u ) + & + & n_12 _ 6 ( u ^u ^ + u^u^- u ^u^ ) + & + & n_13 _ 6 ( u ^- u^ ) ( u ^- u^ )  . 
 [ c7 ] at present , little is known of the finite parts of the couplings @xmath50 . 
 the @xmath47 lagrangian at chiral order @xmath27 is _ 
 emw^(0 ) = g_emw ( _ 6 u q u^ )  , [ c8 ] where @xmath51 is an _ a priori _ unknown coupling constant . 
 it has been calculated recently in ref . 
 @xcite , g_emw = ( -0.62 0.19 ) g_8 m_^2  . 
 [ c9 ] we note in passing that despite the presence of just one charge matrix @xmath52 the lagrangian of eq . 
 ( [ c8 ] ) indeed describes @xmath53 effects . 
 a second factor of @xmath52 could be decomposed into a combination of the unit matrix and the @xmath54 matrix @xmath55 . 
 the contribution from @xmath56 would vanish , leaving the form of eq . 
 ( [ c8 ] ) . 
 the second operator that we use to provide counterterm contributions is the @xmath47 lagrangian at chiral order @xmath28 . in terms of the notation @xmath57 
 , we have & & l_emw^(2 ) = e^2 g_8  . the first six operators in the above list appear in ref .  @xcite . 
 the remaining three are also required for our analysis . to our knowledge 
 , none of the divergent or finite parts of the @xmath58 are yet known . 
 the leading em corrections arise from the processes of fig .  [ 
 fig : f1 ] and fig . 
 [ fig : f2 ] . contributions to fig . 
 [ fig : f2 ] occur in two distinct classes , those explicitly containing virtual photons ( fig . 
 [ fig : f3 ] ) and those with no explicit virtual photons ( fig . 
 [ fig : f4 ] ) . 
 the latter are induced by em mass corrections and by insertions of @xmath51 . in figs . 
 [ fig : f3],[fig : f4 ] , the larger bold - face vertices are where the weak interaction occurs .    the integrals which occur in our chiral analysis are standard and already appear in the literature ( _ e.g. _ see ref . 
 @xcite or ref . 
 it suffices here to point out that all divergent parts of the one - loop integrals are ultimately expressible in terms of the @xmath59-dimensional integral a ( m^2 ) dk    1 k^2 - m^2 = ^d-4  , [ bpp1 ] where @xmath60 is the integration measure , @xmath61 is the scale associated with dimensional regularization and @xmath62 is the singular quantity  . 
 [ bpp2 ] each amplitude in the discussion to follow will be expressed as a sum of a finite contribution and a singular term containing @xmath62 . 
 .1 cm 0.2 cm      we begin with the @xmath27 amplitudes , _ + -^(e^2 p^0 ) = - f_k f_^2 ( g_8 m_^2 + g_emw )  , _ 00^(e^2 p^0 ) = 0  , _ + 0^(e^2 p^0 ) = a_+-^(e^2 p^0 )  . 
 [ d1 ] although these have already been determined in ref . 
 @xcite , we include them here for the sake of completeness . 
 they are finite - valued and require no regularization procedure . 
 next come the amplitudes of order @xmath63 , expressed as _ 
 p^2 ) = a_i^(expl ) + a_i^(impl ) + a_i^(ct )  . 
 [ d2 ] the superscript ` expl ' refers to figs . 
 [ fig : f1](a),(c ) and fig . 
 [ fig : f3 ] where virtual photons are _ explicitly _ present , whereas superscript ` impl ' refers to fig . 
 [ fig : f4 ] where em effects are _ implicitly _ present via em mass splittings and @xmath51 insertions . the final term 
 @xmath64 is the counterterm amplitude . 
 we turn first to the class @xmath65 of explicit photonic diagrams . for these contributions , 
 it is consistent to take meson masses in the isospin limit . 
 we find & & f_k f_^2 g_8 a_+-^(expl ) = ( m_k^2 - m_^2 ) _ + - ( m _ ) + & & + 4 - 6 ^d-4 e^2 m_k^2  , + & & f_k f_^2 g_8 a_00^(expl ) = 0  , [ d7 ] + & & f_k f_^2 g_8 a_+0^(expl ) = 4 m_^2 - 6 ^d-4 e^2 m_^2  . 
 the quantity @xmath66 , which appears in the above expression for @xmath67 , is associated with the processes of figs .  [ 
 fig : f1](a),(c ) . due to 
 such processes , the weak decay amplitudes @xmath68 will develop infrared ( ir ) singularities in the presence of electromagnetism . 
 to tame such behavior , an ir regulator is introduced and appears as a parameter in the amplitudes . for our work , this takes the form of a photon squared - mass @xmath69 . 
 @xmath66 is given by _ + - ( m_^2 ) & = & 1 4  , [ a50 ] where = ( 1 - 4 m_^2 /m_k^2 ) ^1/2 [ a50a ] and a ( ) & = & 1 + 1 + ^2 2  , + h ( ) & = & ^2 + + 2 f ( 1 + 2 ) - 2 f ( - 1 2 )  , [ a51 ] + f(x ) & = & - _ 0^x dt   1 t |1 - t|  . notice that the function @xmath66 is complex , and both its real and imaginary parts have a logarithmic singularity as @xmath70 . 
 the solution to this problem is well known ; in order to get an infrared - finite decay rate , one has to consider the process with emission of soft _ real _ photons , whose singularity will cancel the one coming from soft _ virtual _ photons . 
 we shall be more explicit on this point in sect . 
 .1 cm 0.5 cm    the amplitudes @xmath67 and @xmath71 each contain an additive divergent term ( proportional to @xmath62 ) and also depend on the arbitrary scale @xmath61 introduced in dimensional regularization of loop integrals . 
 both these features will require the introduction of counterterms . 
 next comes the class @xmath72 of diagrams in fig . 
 [ fig : f4 ] not containing explicit photons . for such contributions 
 , one must be sure to include all possible effects of chiral order @xmath27 and @xmath28 and treat the various terms in a consistent manner . 
 thus for the contributions to fig . 
 [ fig : f4 ] , isospin - invariant meson masses are used in amplitudes involving @xmath73 and @xmath74 , whereas electromagnetic mass splittings appear in amplitudes involving @xmath75 . 
 we write the results as sums of complex - valued finite amplitudes @xmath76 and divergent parts , essentially the amplitudes @xmath77 , _ 
 i^(impl ) = re  f_i ( ) + i i m  f_i ( ) + ^d-4 d_i   , ( i = + - , 00 , + 0 )  . 
 [ d8 ] the scale - dependence in @xmath76 comes entirely from its real part @xmath78 . 
 we express the @xmath79 in terms of dimensionless amplitudes @xmath80 , e  f_i ( ) = _ i g_8 m_k^2 f_^2 f_k a_i^(impl ) ( )  , [ d8p ] with @xmath81 , @xmath82 . 
 since the @xmath83 coefficients have rather cumbersome analytic forms , we find it most convenient to express them in the compact form a_i^(impl ) ( ) = b_i^(m ) m_^2 f^2 + b_i^(g ) g f^2 +  , [ d8q ] where g  g_emw / g_8  . 
 [ d8r ] the coefficients appearing in eq . 
 ( [ d8q ] ) are given in table 1 . 
 l|cccc + & @xmath84 & @xmath85 & @xmath86 & @xmath87 + @xmath88 & @xmath89 & @xmath90 & @xmath91 & @xmath92 + @xmath93 & @xmath94 & @xmath95 & @xmath96 & @xmath97 + @xmath98 & @xmath99 & @xmath100 & @xmath101 & @xmath102 +    the finite functions also have imaginary parts @xmath103 which arise entirely from the processes in fig .  [ fig : f4](c ) . from direct calculation 
 we find & & f_k f_^2 f^2 g_8 i m  f_+- = - 16  , + & & f_k f_^2 f^2 g_8 i m  f_00 = - 16 ( m_k^2 - m_^2 )  , [ d8s ] + & & f_k f_^2 f^2 g_8 i m  f_+0 = 32 ( m_k^2 - 2 m_^2 ) ( m_^2 + g )  , where @xmath104 is defined in eq . 
 ( [ a50a ] ) . as a check on our calculation 
 , we have verified that the above results are identical to those obtained from unitarity . 
 the singular parts of @xmath105 are embodied by the @xmath106-functions , & & f^2 f_k f_^2 g_8 d_+- 
 = m_k^2 + m_^2  , + & & f^2 f_k f_^2 g_8 d_00 = ( m_k^2 - m_^2 )  , [ d8a ] + & & f^2 f_k f_^2 g_8 d_+0 = m_k^2 + m_^2  . 
 to arrive at the above , we have used both the correspondence between @xmath107 and @xmath45 given in eq . 
 ( [ c5 ] ) and also the relation m_^^2 - m_^0 ^ 2  =  m_k^+^2 - m_k^0 ^ 2  , [ d8b ] in the evaluation of loop integrals . 
 the latter follows from dashen s theorem  @xcite and is justified since terms violating dashen s theorem would begin to contribute at the higher chiral order @xmath108 . 
 .1 cm 0.2 cm      in order to cancel the singular @xmath62-dependence in the @xmath0 amplitudes , it is necessary to calculate all possible counterterm amplitudes which can contribute . 
 these enter in a variety of ways , as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : f5 ] where the small bold - face square denotes the counterterm vertex . for figs .

 [ fig : f5](c ) it has @xmath36 .      using the lagrangians @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 
 we determine the counterterm amplitudes to be & & f^2 f_k f_^2 g_8 a_+-^(ct ) = + & & m_k^2 ( e^2 f^2 ( x_1 - 4 u_1 - 83 u_2 ) + m_^2 ( 8 n_7 - 4 n_8 - 4 n_9 ) ) + & & + m_^2 ( e^2 f^2 ( x_2 + 4 u_1 + 83 u_2 ) - m_^2 ( 4 n_5 + 8 n_7 + 2 n_8 ) )  , + & & f^2 f_k f_^2 g_8 a_00^(ct ) = ( m_k^2 - m_^2 ) e^2 f^2  , [ d5 ] + & & f^2 f_k f_^2 g_8 a_+0^(ct ) = m_k^2 ( e^2 f^2 x_3 - m_^2 ( 4 n_5 + 4 n_8 ) ) + & & + m_^2 ( e^2 f^2 x_4 - m_^2 ( 2 n_8 + 4 n_9 ) )  , where the @xmath112 are coefficients in the @xmath113 lagrangian @xmath109 of eq .

 the coefficients @xmath117 of the divergent parts of @xmath118 have already been specified in the literature  @xcite and hence the @xmath61-dependences of @xmath119 , @xmath120 are known from the renormalization group equations . 
 we infer the @xmath121 coefficients in this paper by canceling divergences in the @xmath122 amplitudes . upon combining results 
 obtained thus far , we find the new results x_00 & = & - 13 m_^2 e^2 f^2 - 3 g e^2 f^2  , + x_1 & = & 3 + 272 m_^2 e^2 f^2 - 13 2 g e^2 f^2  , + x_2 & = & 3 - 18 m_^2 e^2 f^2 - 7 g e^2 f^2  , [ d9c ] + x_3 & = & - 73 m_^2 e^2 f^2 - 89 18 g e^2 f^2  , + x_4 & = & 6 - 2 m_^2 e^2 f^2 - 86 9 g e^2 f^2  , where we recall @xmath123 . 
 removal of the infrared divergence from the expression for the decay rate is achieved by taking into account the process @xmath124 . for soft photons 
 , whose energy is below the detector resolution @xmath125 , this process can not be experimentally distinguished from @xmath126 , so the observable quantity involves the inclusive sum over the @xmath127 and @xmath128 final states .    at the order we are working , 
 it is sufficient to consider just the emission of a single photon . 
 the amplitude for the radiative decay is given in lowest order by @xmath129 where @xmath130 and @xmath131 are the polarization and momentum of the emitted photon . 
 + the infrared - finite observable decay rate is @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134 is the differential phase space factor for each process . 
 the infrared divergent ( ird ) part of @xmath135 is seen to be @xmath136^{2 } \int \ , d \phi_{+ - } \   \   2 \alpha 
 \ , { \cal r}e   { b}_{+ - } ( m_{\gamma } )    \right . \ \ . \label{v3}\ ] ] equation  ( [ v3 ] ) displays explicitly the singularity and shows that the imaginary part of @xmath137 has no observable effect at this order . 
 this result has been shown to be true to all orders in @xmath24  @xcite . 
 for @xmath138 we get the following expression , up to terms of order @xmath139 , _ + - ( ) = ^2 d _ + -  i_+-(m _ , )  , [ x1 ] where _ + - ( m _ , ) =  , [ x2 ] with & & f ( ) = 1 + 1 + ^2 2  . 
 [ x3 ] from these explicit expressions of @xmath140 and @xmath141 it is easy to see that the combination @xmath142 does not depend on the infrared regulator @xmath143 . however , this combination has a dependence on the experimental resolution @xmath125 . to obtain a meaningful prediction therefore requires knowledge of the experimental treatment of soft photons 
 . a careful discussion of this point will appear in ref . 
 @xcite . 
 a generalization of the above considerations beyond the order @xmath144 in chpt leads to the following parameterization , _ + - ( ) = d _ + -  g_+- ( )  | a_+ -^(0 ) + a_+ -^(1 ) |^2  , [ v4 ] where to first order in @xmath24 , g_+- ( ) = 1 + 2 re b_+ - ( m _ ) + i_+- ( m _ , )  . 
 [ v4a ] with the prescription of dropping the term proportional to @xmath145 in the photonic loop contribution , the electromagnetic amplitude @xmath146 can be read from eqs . 
 ( [ d1]),([d7]),([d8]),([d5 ] ) 
 .      the physical amplitudes will be complex - valued functions , as dictated by unitarity . 
 the real parts are obtained by combining the finite loop amplitudes ( eq .  ( [ d7 ] ) for @xmath147 and eqs .  ( [ d8p]),([d8q ] ) along with table 1 for @xmath105 ) with the counterterm amplitudes of eq . 
 ( [ d5 ] ) , e  a_i^(e^2 p^2 )  =  _ i g_8 m_k^2 f_^2 f_k  . 
 [ d15 ] in order to make the scale - dependence of @xmath148 explicit , we write e 
 a_i^(loop )  =  b_i + c_i  . 
 [ d16 ] numerical determination of the above quantities will depend on @xmath31 ( obtained from ref . 
 @xcite ) , @xmath107 and @xmath51 ( given in eq .  ( [ c9 ] ) ) . 
 we obtain the central values    l b_+- = 11.8 10 ^ -3  , + b_00 = - 0.5 10 ^ -3  , + b_+0 = - 1.3 10 ^ -3  ,    l c_+- = 7.1 10 ^ -3  , + c_00 = -3.9 10 ^ -3  , + c_+0 = -2.7 10 ^ -3  .    [ d17 ]    the imaginary parts of the physical amplitudes can be either determined from unitarity or read off from eqs . 
 ( [ d8]),([d8s ] ) . of most interest is the em shift in @xmath149 , as only it receives the @xmath150 ( @xmath3 ) enhancement , ( i m  a_2^em ) & = & 32  , [ d17a ] where @xmath151 and @xmath152 are pion - pion t - matrix elements in the isospin basis . 
 the above three contributions have physically distinct origins ; the first involves the direct effect of electromagnetism on the @xmath153 decay amplitude , the second arises from final state scattering in which electromagnetism induces leakage from @xmath154 to @xmath155 , and the third is due to the shift in two - pion phase space produced by the electromagnetic mass shift  @xcite . 
 despite the presence of many unknown finite counterterms , it is possible to apply the numerical results of eq . 
 ( [ d17 ] ) and obtain rough estimates of the em corrections . 
 the reasoning is that since the physical amplitudes are independent of the scale @xmath61 , there must be compensating @xmath61-dependence between the chiral logarithms of eq . 
 ( [ d16 ] ) and the counterterms 
 . therefore the counterterms must be at least of the same order - of - magnitude as the chiral logs or even larger . 
 we have adopted the operational procedure of assuming the counterterm contribution @xmath156 vanishes at the scale @xmath157 , and we assign an uncertainty given by @xmath158 . 
 this leads to the numerical values ( a_0^em ) & = & ( 0.024 0.026 ) 10 ^ -7  m_k^0  , + ( a_2^em ) & = & ( 0.015 0.022 ) 10 ^ -7  m_k^0  , + ( a_2^+em ) & = & ( - 0.005 0.005 ) 10 ^ -7  m_k^0  , [ e1 ] + a_5/2 & = & ( 0.012 0.016 ) 10 ^ -7  m_k^0  , with @xmath159 and @xmath160 . 
 specifically , for the em shift @xmath161 calculated in ref . 
 @xcite , we now have the extended result  = - ( 2.0 2.2 )  %  . 
 [ e2 ] if one allows for the uncertainty in @xmath51 in addition to those in the counterterm values , we find  = - ( 2.0^+4.0_-2.2 )  %  . 
 [ e3 ] in the numerical findings of eqs . 
 ( [ e1])-([e3 ] ) , the error bars are seen to be almost as large or larger than the signal . in our opinion , this is the best that one can do within a strict chiral perturbation theory approach .      1 . 
 since the central values of the amplitudes have @xmath162 , the electromagnetic loop corrections are seen to produce @xmath20 effects , although the uncertainties of the counterterm values overwhelms the numerical result . 
 a phenomenological analysis  @xcite based on @xmath163-wave pion - pion scattering lengths and forward dispersion relations gives @xmath164 . 
 yet an isospin analysis of @xmath6 decays yields @xmath165 . 
 presumably this difference of nearly @xmath166 can be reconciled by subtracting em effects from the @xmath6 decays . 
 the main em shift should be in @xmath10 as only this angle experiences a @xmath3 enhancement . 
 using eq . 
 ( [ d17a ] ) to calculate the angle @xmath167 of eq . 
 ( [ a6 ] ) , we find _ 2 = a_0^(e^0p^2 ) _ 
 2^(e^0p^2 ) 4.5^o  . 
 [ e4 ] this evaluation , valid at order @xmath168 , is seen to worsen the discrepancy between the two determinations . to reveal the explanation behind this puzzle requires more work . 
 @xcite 3 .   finally , the most important implication of these estimates is that the electromagnetic shifts in @xmath12 are not large , being only a few percent . 
 naive estimates allow the possibility that this shift could be much larger , perhaps even being a major portion of @xmath12 . 
 our previous work at the leading order in the chiral expansion yielded a small effect . 
 one motivation of the present calculation was to see if the next order effects upset this conclusion . 
 our estimates show that the natural size of the shift in @xmath12 remains at the few percent level . 
 this has been a complicated calculation with many different lagrangians , describing different aspects of electromagnetic physics , required to obtain the full effect . 
 these include explicit photon loops , mass shifts in the mesons propagating in loops and the short - distance electroweak interaction . 
 the chiral power counting was crucial in sorting out which effects must be included for a consistent calculation . 
 the resulting structure is universal and model independent . 
 however , it is a prelude to more fully predictive applications , as there remain unknown low energy constants which are not predicted by chiral symmetry alone . 
 different models can be used to estimate the renormalized constants which appear in the chiral lagrangians , and these model predictions can then be readily translated into the physical amplitudes through the use of our calculation . in a following publication , 
 we attempt to describe the extent that this may be accomplished using dispersive techniques to match long and short distance physics  @xcite

 @xcite ] only em corrections to the dominant octet nonleptonic hamiltonian are considered. 
 such corrections modify not only the original @xmath3 amplitude but also induce @xmath4 contributions as well. by the standards of particle physics, 
 this subject is very old  @xcite. yet 
, there exists in the literature no satisfactory theoretical treatment. 
 this is due largely to complications of the strong interactions at low energy. 
 fortunately, the modern machinary of the standard model, especially the method of chiral lagrangians, provides the means to perform an analysis which is both correct and structurally complete. 
 that doing so requires no fewer than _ eight _ distinct chiral langrangians is an indication of the complexity of the undertaking. 
 there is, however, a problem with the usual chiral lagrangian methodology. the cost of implementing its calculational scheme is the introduction of many unknown constants, the finite counterterms associated with the regularization of divergent contributions. 
 as regards em corrections to nonleptonic kaon decay, it is impractical to presume that these many unknowns will be inferred phenomenologically in the reasonably near future, or perhaps ever. as a consequence, in order to obtain an acceptable phenomenological description, it will be necessary to proceed beyond the confines of strict chiral perturbation theory. in a previous publication  @xcite 
, we succeeded in accomplishing this task in a limited context, @xmath5 decay in the chiral limit. 
 we shall extend this work to a full phenomenological treatment of the @xmath0 decays in the next paper  @xcite of this series. 
 the proper formal analysis, which is the subject of this paper, begins in sect.  2 where we briefly describe the construction of @xmath6 decay amplitudes in the presence of electromagnetic corrections. 
 in section 3, we begin to implement the chiral program by specifying the collection of strong and electroweak chiral lagrangians which bear on our analysis. 
 the calculation of @xmath6 decay amplitudes is covered in section 4 and our concluding remarks appear in section 5

"understanding the processes involved in the supernova explosions , in the creation of stellar compact objects and in their temporal evolution requires a huge multidisciplinary effort with investigations in areas as distinct as nuclear and particle physics , thermodynamics , quantum field theory and astrophysics .    in the present work we concentrate on the description of neutron stars . from very low densities up to the high densities present in their core 
 , the constitution of these compact objects is a great source of speculation . at low densities 
 there can be neutrons , protons , electrons and possibly neutrinos ( at finite temperatures ) . at high densities , 
 stellar matter can be much more complex , including hyperons , kaons and even deconfined quarks . 
 many works considering the construction of equations of state ( eos ) used to describe compact objects have already been done @xcite . 
 once a certain eos is obtained , it serves as input to the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations ( tov ) @xcite and the output gives the structure of the compact stars , characterized by their mass and radius . 
 an appropriate eos or an inadequate one can only be chosen or ruled out once astronomical observations are used as constraints . 
 although some observational results are known , many uncertainties exist . 
 it is still unknown whether the neutron stars are composed only of hadrons and leptons , necessary to ensure chemical equilibrium and charge neutrality @xcite , if they are quark stars @xcite or even hybrid stars , containing both hadron and quark matter in their interior @xcite . 
 each one of these possibilities is represented by a great variety of relativistic and even non - relativistic models used to built the eos . 
 we next investigate hybrid stars only , whose existence is a source of intense discussions in the literature @xcite . 
 the discussion presented in @xcite is particularly interesting because the existence of quark stars is shown to be questionable within the calculations performed ( which depend strongly on a specific parametrization ) . 
 moreover , it is also pointed out that the possibility of a mixed population ( or hybrid stars ) is compatible with the calculations of model dependent quark matter nucleation , what reinforces the interest in the calculations of hybrid stars as compact objects . 
 recent calculations show the importance of the nucleation mechanism in the process of phase transition from hadronic to quark matter @xcite . 
 the main reason for the present work is the fact that many astrophysicists claim that the mixed phase is only a hypothetical choice and can not be checked . 
 moreover , some authors calculated macroscopic quantities as radii and masses for hybrid stars with and without the mixed phase and concluded that the differences were not significant @xcite or that the region corresponding to the hadron - quark mixed phase is too narrow @xcite . 
 although hybrid stars have been obtained with different combinations of models for the hadron and the quark phases , most of the discussions on the use of gibbs and maxwell constructions have been based on the mit bag model @xcite for the description of the quark phase . 
 the mit bag model @xcite is a very simple model that does not reproduce some of the necessary features of qcd at high densities , as chiral symmetry , for instance . 
 as it is easily checked on the literature , all results for compact stars are model dependent . 
 hence , before completely ruling out the need for the gibbs construction and the consequent existence of the mixed phase in hybrid stars , it is desirable that another calculation with a different model for the quark phase is considered . 
 that is the basis of the calculations and discussion that follows .    in the present paper , 
 the hadron phase is described by the non - linear walecka model ( nlw ) @xcite and the quark phase by the nambu - jona - lasinio model ( njl ) @xcite . 
 two different constructions are made : one with a mixed phase ( mp ) and another without the mixed phase , where the hadron and quark phases are in direct contact . in the first case , 
 neutron and electron chemical potentials are continuous throughout the stellar matter , based on the standard thermodynamical rules for phase coexistence known as gibbs conditions . in the second case , 
 the electron chemical potential suffers a discontinuity because only the neutron chemical potential is imposed to be continuous . 
 the condition underlying the fact that only a single chemical potential is common to both phases is known as maxwell construction . in our approach 
 we ignore surface and coulomb effects for the structure in the mixed phase so the leptons are taken into account as free fermi gases . however , it is worthy pointing out that the energy density in mixed phases should depend on the eletromagnetic and surface contributions and this is commonly known as finite size effects . in @xcite it was shown that for a weak surface tension the eos resembles the one obtained with a gibbs construction while for a strong surface tension , the maxwell construction was reproduced . 
 unfortunatelly , the surface energy coefficient is not well described yet @xcite . 
 the differences between stellar structures obtained with both constructions are discussed through out the present paper . 
 a similar calculation was done in @xcite , where the effects of different lepton fractions on protoneutron stars with trapped neutrinos were investigated . 
 although the result for zero temperature was also presented , its validity when trapped neutrinos are enforced is only academic because the neutrino mean free path at t=0 is larger than the neutron star radius . 
 while in @xcite no hyperons were included in the hadronic phase , they are also taken into account in the present paper for two parametrizations of the nlw model . 
 notice , however , that @xmath0 quarks were also considered in the quark phase described in @xcite .    in works involving quark @xcite or hybrid stars @xcite 
 , it is seen that the njl model gives results that are quite different from the ones obtained with the mit model . 
 the fact that the njl model incorporates chiral symmetry and that the strange quark appears only in densities much higher than the @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks are the main reasons for the differences . 
 hence , the calculations for the hybrid stars are here done with the njl model so the previous conclusions on the mixed phase are confirmed or refuted . 
 the consequences of the inclusion of the @xmath0-quark in the njl model at quite high densities is also seen once a comparison between the two versions of the njl model , i.e. , su(2 ) and su(3 ) is performed . 
 whenever the su(2 ) version of the njl is used to describe quark matter , the corresponding hadron phase is strangeness free , i.e. , no hyperons are considered . 
 two parameter sets are used for each case considered so that the model dependence can be established . 
 the paper is organized as follows : in sec . 
 2 we show the lagrangian densities of the models considered and describe the formalism used ; in sec . 
 3 we present and discuss the results ; in sec . 
 4 we draw our final conclusions . 
 we next give some of the main equations related to the two models used in our investigation . 
 detailed calculations are extensively available in the literature and hence are omitted in the present paper . 
 two possible systems are studied : one comprehends 8 baryons in the hadron phase and 3 quarks in the quark phase and the other includes only protons and neutrons in the hadron phase and the corresponding @xmath1 an @xmath2 quarks in the quark phase . in most cases , 
 our studies refer to a hadron matter with all 8 baryons and a quark matter with the 3 possible quarks . 
 the njl model is defined by the lagrangian density @xmath3\ ] ] @xmath4 + det[\bar{q}_i(1-\gamma_5)q_j ] \ } , \label{lagnjl}\ ] ] where @xmath5 are the quark fields and @xmath6 @xmath7 , are the u(3 ) flavour matrices . 
 the model parameters are the current quark mass matrix @xmath8 , the coupling constants @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and the cutoff in 3-momentum space @xmath11 . 
 the thermodynamical potential density is given by @xmath12 where the energy density is @xmath13 @xmath14 in the above expressions , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the chemical potential ( number density ) of particles of type @xmath18 , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are included in order to ensure @xmath21 in the vacuum . 
 the quark condensates and the quark densities are defined , for each of the flavors @xmath22 , respectively , as : @xmath23 @xmath24    minimizing the thermodynamical potential @xmath25 with respect to the constituent quark masses @xmath26 leads to three gap equations for the masses @xmath26 
 @xmath27 with cyclic permutations of @xmath28 .    the pressure can be found from @xmath29 the relations between the chemical potentials of the different particles required by @xmath30- equilibrium are given by @xmath31 and for charge neutrality we must impose @xmath32    in order to obtain the njl su(2 ) model we just need to neglect the terms related to the strange quark in equations 2 , 4 and 5 . 
 it means that @xmath33 . 
 the parameter sets of the njl model used in the present work are given in table 1 . 
 the lagrangian density for the nlw model reads @xmath34 
 @xmath35\psi_b   + \frac{1}{2}(\partial_{\mu}\phi\partial^{\mu}\phi -m_s^2 \phi^2 ) -\frac{1}{3!}\kappa 
 \phi ^{3 } -\frac{1}{4!}\lambda \phi ^{4}\ ] ] @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 the hyperon coupling constants are defined as @xmath39 .    in a mean field approximation 
 the energy density reads @xmath40 @xmath41 and the pressure becomes @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the spin degeneracy factor . 
 the conditions of chemical equilibrium are also imposed through the two independent chemical potentials @xmath45 and @xmath46 and it implies that @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 for the charge neutrality , we must have @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 stand , respectively , for the electric charges of baryons and leptons .    when the system is constituted only of protons and neutrons , the sum on the baryons appearing in the equations above 
 are restricted to the nucleons and the only condition for chemical equilibrium is the last one in ( [ betahadron ] ) . 
 two sets of parameters were chosen and they are given in table 2 . 
 the following parameters are equal for both sets : @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 mev , @xmath56 mev and @xmath57 mev .      as we are dealing with neutral stellar matter in @xmath30- equilibrium in both quark and hadron phases according to eqs . 
 ( [ betaquark])-([chargequark ] ) and ( [ betahadron])-([chargehadron ] ) respectively , the electrons and muons have to be introduced . 
 they are normally included as free fermi gases obeying the following lagrangian density : @xmath58 expressions for energy density and pressure in a mft become : @xmath59 and @xmath60      we next build a mixed phase ( mp ) constituted of hadrons and quarks , which interpolates between the hadron ( hp ) and the quark phase ( qp ) . in the mixed phase charge neutrality 
 is not imposed locally but only globally . 
 this means that quark and hadron phases are not neutral separately , but rather , the system prefers to rearrange itself so that @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the charge density of the phase @xmath18 , @xmath63 is the volume fraction occupied by the quark phase , and @xmath64 is the electric charge density of leptons . 
 according to the gibbs conditions for phase coexistence , the neutron chemical potentials , the electron chemical potentials and pressures have to be identical in both phases , i.e. @xcite , @xmath65 as a consequence , the energy density and total baryon density ( no leptons included ) in the mixed phase read @xmath66 and @xmath67      much simpler than the case above , we just need to find the point where @xmath68 and then construct the eos . in this case the electron chemical potential suffers a discontinuity when passing from the hadron to the quark phase as expected from the simple use of the maxwell conditions . 
 in the graphs shown next su(3 ) stands for the quark phase taking into account the strange quark and su(2 ) represents the njl model without the strange quark . 
 gm1 and gm3 represent the hadron phase with their respective set of parameters . 
 systems without strangeness are described by protons and neutrons in the hadron phase and quarks @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the quark phase . 
 systems with strangeness also accommodate the hyperons in the hadron phase and quark @xmath0 in the quark phase .    in fig . 
 1 the eos for the pure hadron and pure quark matter are shown . 
 they are the base to built the eos of the hybrid stars . 
 the kick , or variation , in curvature in the quark system is due to the appearance of the @xmath0-quark .    in figs . 2 and 3 the eos for the two types of hybrid stars 
 are shown with parametrizations gm1 and gm3 respectively for the hadron phase . 
 two parametrizations ( su(3 ) hk and su(3 ) rkh ) are used for the quark phase in both figures . in both figures the hyperons and strange quarks are included . 
 the eos of the hybrid stars with mixed phase are built by the superposition of the eos for the quark and hadron matter , plus the eos for the mixed phase . 
 the plateau in the eos of the hybrid stars without mixed phase shows a vivid phase transition from hadron to quark matter . 
 one can see that gm1 produces a much larger quark phase in both constructions while gm3 gives rise to a very large mixed phase when it is present and a quark phase much smaller than the hadron phase if a maxwell construction is used . 
 this consideration is true independently of the parametrization used in the quark phase , what means that the size of each phase is basically dependent on the hadron phase parametrization , at least for the choices we have considered . 
 this fact has obvious consequences in the constituents of the stellar matter .    in figs . 4 and 5 we compare hybrid stars without the mixed phase built with the su(2 ) and su(3 ) njl models , to understand the role played by the strange quark . 
 whenever su(2)set1 is used , the hadron phase is minimal and the eos is practically given only by the quark phase . 
 in all the other cases the size of each phase is mainly determined by the hadron phase parametrization , with small variations in the size of each phase . 
 notice that the @xmath1 and @xmath2 quark vacuum masses are not identical , being the smallest for the su(2)set1 parametrization , as seen in table 1 . 
 we use all the eos studied and commented before as input to the tov equations to obtain the neutron star profiles that are shown in fig . 
 6 , 7 and table 3 . 
 the tails of the hadron and hybrid stars were obtained with the insertion of the bps eos @xcite . 
 as expected , the maximum masses for the hadron stars are larger than for the hybrid stars . 
 when the maxwell construction is used , the resulting mass - radius curve shows a kink , produced by the sharp transition in the eos . 
 a similar result is shown in @xcite and it is easier to see in fig . 7 , where we once more compare the hybrid stars without mixed phase built with the njl su(2 ) and su(3 ) models . 
 as a consequence of the eos , gm1 and gm3 produce identical stellar profiles if only protons , neutrons and consequently quarks @xmath1 and @xmath2 are considered with su(2)set1 . 
 su(2)set2 produces different results . 
 if only stars with strangeness are considered , gm1 always result in stars with larger maximum masses and radii than gm3 .    in table 3 
 we also show the results for the central energy density @xmath19 . 
 @xmath69 corresponds to the point where the hadron phase disappears , either because of the onset of a mixed phase ( whenever @xmath70 is also shown ) or giving rise to the quark phase ( otherwise ) . 
 if strangeness are considered , in hybrid stars without mixed phase , the central energy density may lie within the hadron phase as in gm3@xmath71su(3)hk and gm3@xmath71su(3)rkh . 
 this means that if a phase transition to the quark phase occurs , the star becomes unstable . on the other hand , 
 if the parametrization gm1@xmath71su(3)rkh or gm1@xmath71su(3)hk is used , the central energy density lies in the quark phase . 
 if a mixed phase is considered , the central energy density always lies in its interior . as a consequence , 
 the pure quark phase is never present . 
 this is the only effect ( not possible to infer from astronomical observations ) that depends strongly on the choice between gibbs and maxwell constructions . 
 nevertheless , it is well known that the strange quark condensate is very large within the su(3 ) njl model and our results are a consequence of this behaviour . for this specific reason 
 , we have also checked the results for hybrid stars built without strangeness . 
 if strangeness is not included , su(2)set1 gives rise to hybrid stars with central energy densities in the quark phase and su(2)set2 shows unstable solutions after the onset of the quark phase with the gm1 parametrization . 
 analyzing the results shown in table 3 and based on the accuracy of our calculations and the experimental difficulties in the measurements of neutron stars radii , it is fair to say that the method used to built the eos , i.e. , the more rigorous gibbs conditions or the simple use of the maxwell construction give almost indistinguishable results for gravitational masses and radii .    finally , in figs . 
 6 and 7 we have added three lines corresponding to observational constraints . 
 some properties of the neutron stars are determinated by measuring the gravitational redshift of spectral lines produced in neutron star photosphere which provides a direct constraint on the mass - to - radius ratio ( m / r ) . 
 a redshift of @xmath72 from three different transitions of the spectra of the x - ray binary exo0748 - 676 was obtained in @xcite . 
 this redshift corresponds to @xmath73 . 
 the top line corresponds to this constraint , whose validity remains controversial @xcite . on the other hand , the 1e 1207.4 - 5209 neutron star , which is in the center of the supernova remnant pks 1209 - 51/52 was also observed and two absorption features in the source spectrum were detected @xcite . 
 these features were associated with atomic transitions of once - ionized helium in the neutron star atmosphere with a strong magnetic field . 
 this interpretation leads to a redshift of the order of @xmath74 . 
 this redshift imposes another constraint to the mass to radius ratio given by @xmath75 to @xmath76 . 
 this constraint is represented by the two lowest lines . 
 one can see in figs . 
 [ fig:6 ] and [ fig:7 ] that all the curves obtained are consistent with the measurements of @xcite and @xcite by crossing the 3 lines . 
 assuming that hybrid stars are possible remnants of supernova explosions , their constitution becomes important only if their macroscopic quantities can be constrained to astronomical observations . 
 while some calculations practically exclude the existence of hybrid stars @xcite favoring quark stars , others tend to rule out quark stars and favor hybrid stars @xcite . 
 all those conclusions are obviously model dependent and were reached based on the use of the mit bag model to describe quark matter . 
 hybrid stars have a hadron phase , in this paper described by the non - linear walecka model ( nlw ) @xcite and a quark phase . instead of using the usual mit bag model @xcite to build the quark phase , 
 we have opted to use the njl model @xcite to check some of the previous results on the existence of the mixed phase inside hybrid stars . 
 if the hadron phase is constituted of protons and neutrons , the corresponding quark phase has quarks @xmath1 and @xmath2 only and the su(2 ) version of the njl model is used . 
 if the baryonic octet is possible in the hadron phase , quarks @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath0 are present in the quark phase described by the su(3 ) njl model . 
 we have concluded that the results are very model dependent , as expected . 
 the onset of a stable quark phase is practically ruled out . 
 our calculations suggest that stable neutron stars are either of hadronic nature only or bear a mixed phase in their core . concerning the existence of the mixed phase ( mp ) 
 , one can see that the stellar measurable results calculated in the present paper ( mass , radii , central energy density ) depend very little on the choice of the maxwell or the gibbs construction . 
 hence , it is reasonable to claim that the maxwell construction gives satisfactory results . 
 the effects of colour superconductivity are out of the scope of the present work , but it is important to mention that they may play an important role in the description of neutron star matter @xcite . the colour - flavour - locked phase ( cfl ) could turn into a superconducting phase ( 2sc ) before matter is hadronized when we read the qcd phase diagram from high to low densities ( see a figures @xcite , for example ) . 
 this non - continuos transition from the cfl to the 2sc phase in the presence of realistic strange quark masses would certainly affect the description of hybrid stars .

, the constitution of these compact objects is a great source of speculation. at low densities 
 there can be neutrons, protons, electrons and possibly neutrinos ( at finite temperatures ). at high densities, 
 stellar matter can be much more complex, including hyperons, kaons and even deconfined quarks. 
 many works considering the construction of equations of state ( eos ) used to describe compact objects have already been done @xcite. 
 once a certain eos is obtained, it serves as input to the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations ( tov ) @xcite and the output gives the structure of the compact stars, characterized by their mass and radius. 
 an appropriate eos or an inadequate one can only be chosen or ruled out once astronomical observations are used as constraints. 
 although some observational results are known, many uncertainties exist. 
 it is still unknown whether the neutron stars are composed only of hadrons and leptons, necessary to ensure chemical equilibrium and charge neutrality @xcite, if they are quark stars @xcite or even hybrid stars, containing both hadron and quark matter in their interior @xcite. 
 each one of these possibilities is represented by a great variety of relativistic and even non - relativistic models used to built the eos. 
 we next investigate hybrid stars only, whose existence is a source of intense discussions in the literature @xcite. 
 the discussion presented in @xcite is particularly interesting because the existence of quark stars is shown to be questionable within the calculations performed ( which depend strongly on a specific parametrization ). 
 moreover, it is also pointed out that the possibility of a mixed population ( or hybrid stars ) is compatible with the calculations of model dependent quark matter nucleation, what reinforces the interest in the calculations of hybrid stars as compact objects. 
 recent calculations show the importance of the nucleation mechanism in the process of phase transition from hadronic to quark matter @xcite. 
 the main reason for the present work is the fact that many astrophysicists claim that the mixed phase is only a hypothetical choice @xcite. 
 it is our aim to show that the existence of hybrid stars is not only compatible with the calculations of @xcite, but it is also supported by the results of @xcite and @xcite. 
 in the present work, we use a relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) approach @xcite to calculate the equation of state ( eos ) of a hybrid star. 
 the rmf approach is based on the mean - field approximation, where the nucleon - nucleon and nucleon - hyperon interactions are taken into account, but the nucleon - hyperon and hyperon - hyperon","Fluency: 3 - The summary is mostly readable and grammatically correct, but it includes some incomplete sentences and abrupt transitions (e.g., ""the rmf approach is based on the mean - field approximation, where the nucleon - nucleon and nucleon - hyperon interactions are taken into account, but the nucleon - hyperon and hyperon - hyperon"" is cut off).  

Factuality: 4 - The summary accurately reflects the source, including key points about neutron stars, hybrid stars, and the models used (e.g., NLW and NJL). However, it introduces a new claim (""it is our aim to show..."") that is not explicitly stated in the input, which slightly deviates from strict factuality.  

Coverage: 4 - The summary covers the main problem (understanding neutron/hybrid stars), methods (EOS, TOV equations, and specific models), and key findings (uncertainties in composition, mixed phase debate). However, it omits some details about observational constraints and the critique of the MIT bag model, which are important in the original text."
"studies of lateral interactions between adsorbed particles are motivated by the need to understand the origin of the wide variety of ordered overlayers and phase transitions at fractional adsorbate coverage on metal surfaces . 
 these interactions have contributions ranging from short - range and van der waals to long - range dipole - dipole , and lattice - mediated interactions  @xcite . 
 hard - square short - range interactions and dipole - dipole long - range interactions are the major contributions to the lateral interactions for bromine adsorption on ag(100 )  @xcite . in this paper 
 , we explore the validity and applicability of such a model for adsorption of chlorine on ag(100 ) . 
 halide electrosorption on single - crystal metal electrode surfaces is a good model system for studying the properties of the electrode - electrolyte interface in an electrochemical cell . due to its relative simplicity 
 , it can be used to distinguish between the various contributions of different parameters according to the effect of their inclusion on the overall behavior of the system . 
 a mean - field approach is not sufficient , even for the description of one of the simplest halide - electrosorption systems br / ag(100 ) . 
 however , a simple lattice - gas model with constant parameters is sufficient to describe its equilibrium  @xcite , and dynamic  @xcite properties . 
 while the electrosorption of br on single - crystal ag(100 ) from aqueous solution has been extensively studied as an example of adlayer formation in an electrochemical system  @xcite , less attention has been given to the electrosorption of cl  @xcite on ag(100 ) . 
 a lattice - gas model with constant parameters is not sufficient to describe cl / ag(100 ) , therefore this system can be used to further investigate the nature and characteristics of the lateral interactions between the adsorbed halide atoms . in particular , we here develop a self - consistent picture of variable lattice - gas parameters based on the resident charge on the adatoms being coverage dependent or electrode - potential dependent ( through the coverage ) . 
 the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : ii ] 
 we describe an electrostatic model of the adlayer that is used in the simulations , the lateral interaction energies , and the monte carlo methods used . 
 a brief description of the experimental procedure is given in section  [ sec : exp ] . 
 the results of fitting the simulations to experimental data are detailed in section  [ sec : results ] , followed by a brief comparison with br / ag(100 ) in section  [ sec : compare ] . 
 our conclusions are summarized in section  [ sec : conclusions ] . 
 the adsorption of cl ions occurs at the fourfold hollow sites of the ag(100 ) surface  @xcite , which form a square lattice as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : model ] . to approximate the equilibrium behavior of this system 
 , we use a lattice - gas model , in which the lattice sites correspond to the adsorption sites . 
 mitchell  _ et al . _ 
 @xcite used an off - lattice model for the br / ag(100 ) system to show that the br adsorbates spend most of the time near the four - fold hollow sites of the ag(100 ) surface , thus justifying the lattice - gas treatment of halide adsorption . to describe the energy associated with a configuration of adsorbates on the surface , a grand - canonical effective hamiltonian  @xcite is used , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a sum over all pairs of sites , @xmath4 are the lateral interaction energies between particles on the @xmath5th and @xmath6th lattice sites , measured in mev / pair , @xmath7 is the electrochemical potential , measured in mev / particle , and @xmath8 is the total number of lattice sites . 
 the local occupation variable @xmath9 is @xmath10 if site @xmath5 is occupied and @xmath11 otherwise . 
 the long - range interactions , @xmath12 , depend on the distance , @xmath13 , between ions @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( measured in ag(100 ) lattice spacing units , @xmath14   @xcite ) as @xmath15 where the infinite value for @xmath16 indicates nearest - neighbor exclusion , and negative values of @xmath12 denote long - range repulsion . 
 the coverage isotherms were simulated using a square @xmath17 lattice with periodic boundary conditions to reduce finite - size effects . 
 the electrochemical potential @xmath18 is related to the bulk ionic concentration @xmath19 and the electrode potential @xmath20 ( measured in mv ) . in the dilute - solution approximation , 
 the relationship is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an arbitrary constant , @xmath23 is a reference concentration ( here taken to be @xmath24 ) , and @xmath25 is the elementary charge unit  @xcite . 
 the reference potential @xmath26 is chosen sufficiently negative such that the coverage vanishes at @xmath26 for all values of @xmath19 used , and @xmath27 has the sign convention that @xmath28 favors adsorption . 
 the relationship between @xmath29 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is discussed further in the appendix . 
 when cl ions adsorb on the surface , a fraction of their charge is transfered through the external circuit . 
 this fraction , @xmath30 , is negative and is directly related to the average resident charge per ion , @xmath31  @xcite . 
 this relationship is an approximation and is more valid as the potential at the adsorbate approaches the value of the potential in the solution . for the current system s ionic strength , this condition is only approximately satisfied and may be considered as a source of error . 
 we have previously shown  @xcite that for cl / ag(100 ) , the electrosorption valency @xmath0 depends on the coverage @xmath32 , which is defined as @xmath33 in order to investigate such a dependence more thoroughly , we here propose a model with a coverage - dependent next - nearest - neighbor lateral interaction energy @xmath1 , as well . 
 this is motivated by two assumptions : that @xmath0 is coverage dependent and that the major contribution to @xmath1 is due to electrostatic dipole - dipole interactions . a simple electrostatic picture of the adlayer , in which an adsorbate s resident charge and its image charge form a dipole , suggests a relationship between the electrosorption valency and the dipole moment . 
 if @xmath0 is coverage dependent ( @xmath34 ) , then the resident charge is also coverage dependent ( @xmath35 ) , and hence @xmath1 , which is proportional to @xmath36 , is coverage dependent as well ( @xmath37 ) . 
 assuming for simplicity that @xmath0 depends linearly on @xmath32 , @xmath38 the resident charge @xmath39 becomes @xmath40 and @xmath1 takes the form : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a prefactor proportional to the square of a `` dipole  distance '' . 
 this effect is known as _ depolarization _ , and may under extreme conditions lead to the possibilty of a first - order phase transition  @xcite k. the model does produce a first - order transition at room temperature for some parameters that do not fit the experimental data . ] . if @xmath0 is coverage independent ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) , then @xmath1 becomes coverage independent , as well . 
 equilibrium monte carlo ( mc ) simulations were used to measure the equilibrium coverage as a function of @xmath29 , which was then converted to @xmath20 using eq . 
 ( [ eq : mbar ] ) . 
 at each mc step a lattice site , @xmath5 , was chosen randomly , and a change in its occupation variable @xmath44 was attempted with a metropolis acceptance probability  @xcite : @xmath45\ ; ,      \label{eq : p}\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the energy difference between the initial state and the proposed state . 
 the value of @xmath1 was updated in the simulations at each mc step , corresponding to the new proposed coverage . 
 the energy difference @xmath46 was calculated from eq . 
 ( [ eq : h ] ) using two methods , a truncated sum of the contributions of neighboring occupied sites up to five lattice spacings away  @xcite , and a mean - field - enhanced truncated sum up to three lattice spacings  @xcite . in the latter method , energy contributions from adparticles more than three 
 lattice spacings away are calculated using a mean - field estimate as detailed in ref . 
 a detailed description of the experimental procedure is given in ref . 
 @xcite , and only a brief summary follows here . 
 the ag(100 ) single - crystal electrodes were chemically etched in cyanide solution , rinsed in milli - q water , and carefully annealed in a hydrogen flame . 
 they were then quickly transfered into the electrochemical cell after cooling in a stream of argon . using the hanging meniscus technique , a platinum wire counter electrode , and a saturated calomel electrode as reference electrode , 
 the electrochemical measurements were carried out at a temperature of ( @xmath47)@xmath48c . 
 for the chronocoulometric experiments , the potential was set at initial values between @xmath491.375 and @xmath490.300 v vs sce until adsorption equilibrium was established , and then stepped to the final potential of @xmath491.400 v , where the chloride is completely desorbed from the surface . 
 the equilibrium mc simulations were performed at a temperature of @xmath50c for various values of @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . 
 the value of @xmath42 was varied from @xmath11 to @xmath53 mev in steps of @xmath54 mev , while @xmath55 and @xmath56 were varied from @xmath11 to @xmath57 in steps of @xmath58 , resulting in @xmath59 different simulations . 
 the resulting simulated isotherms were fitted to experimental data . 
 this large number of simulations necessitated the choice of the relatively small system size with @xmath60 . 
 the system displays a second - order phase transition from a disordered , low - density phase to an ordered @xmath61 phase  @xcite at an intermediate value of the electrochemical potential . for the steepest part of the isotherm ( fig . 
 [ fig : bestfit ] ) , where critical slowing down due to the phase transition is important , the system was allowed to relax for a longer time to reach equilibrium than for the points further away from the phase transition . 
 we checked for finite - size effects , and no significant difference was observed when comparing the resulting isotherms with isotherms simulated using larger system sizes of @xmath62 , and @xmath63 . 
 a small value of @xmath64 can be used because @xmath32 is not the order parameter corresponding to the @xmath61 phase , and so its fluctuations , which are proportional to d@xmath65d@xmath29 , only diverge logarithmically with @xmath64  @xcite . 
 in addition , better statistics were collected close to the phase transition , using longer runs and more sampling than for points far from the phase transition , where the fluctuations are smaller . 
 using eq . 
 ( [ eq : mbar ] ) , the simulated isotherms were converted from the @xmath29 scale to the @xmath20 scale and then fit to the experimental isotherms . 
 the fitting was done by varying the value of @xmath66 to minimize @xmath67 for each set of values for @xmath42 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . here , @xmath68 is the least - squares sum per degree of freedom , and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the experimental and simulated coverages , respectively , corresponding to the same value of @xmath20 . 
 linear interpolation was used between the simulated data points to calculate @xmath70 for all values of @xmath20 .    from fits to @xmath71 mm and @xmath72 mm experiments , a grid of of values of @xmath67 , was collected . 
 three different models were studied . 
 ( i ) a constant @xmath0 ( i.e. , also constant @xmath1 ) model for which we only considered the simulations with @xmath43 . 
 ( ii ) a model in which only the line with @xmath73 was considered . 
 these values for @xmath55 and @xmath56 were estimated from values of @xmath0 obtained from the experimental data in ref . 
 @xcite using the method in ref 
 .  @xcite . 
 ( iii ) the third model studied was the coverage dependent model with @xmath74 , where no constraints on the values of any of the parameters were imposed , and the whole parameter space was searched for a global minimum .    a three - dimensional plot of the parameter space is shown in fig . 
 [ fig : param](a ) , where the diameters of the symbols are proportional to @xmath75 for fits to @xmath72  mm  ( circles ) and 10 mm  ( squares ) of the mean - field - enhanced simulations . 
 the parameter space for the non - mean - field - enhanced method ( not shown ) is similar . 
 figure  [ fig : param](a ) shows the existence of several local minima and a good overlap between the minima for both concentrations . 
 the position of the accepted global minimum is indicated by the arrows . 
 figure  [ fig : param](b ) is a projection onto the @xmath55 , @xmath56 plane , which shows that the minima are concentrated within one region close to the @xmath43 plane , suggesting a relatively weak dependence of @xmath0 on the coverage . 
 moreover , the @xmath67 values in the @xmath43 plane ( model  ( i ) ) and for @xmath76  ( model  ( ii ) ) are significantly larger than the @xmath67 values for the accepted global minimum ( model  ( iii ) ) . 
 figures  [ fig : param](c ) and  [ fig : param](d ) show that while the magnitude of @xmath55 decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath42 , there is no general trend for @xmath56 as a function of @xmath42 .    due to the existence of several shallow minima of @xmath67 , and due to the limited resolution of the grid in parameter space , we list in table  1 the best - fit parameter values for each model , along with all fits that have @xmath67 within @xmath77 of the best - fit value 
 . one can see in table  1 that there are two possible sets of parameters that fit to the 10  mm data for model  ( iii ) with mean - field - enhanced simulations . to discriminate between these possible fits to the 10  mm data we check if they are also possible fits to the 20  mm experimental data . 
 the first set ( @xmath78 mev ) is the overall best fit for 10 mm . 
 however , it fits only slightly better than the second set ( @xmath79 mev ) , and it is not a possible fit to the 20  mm experimental data . 
 the only parameter set ( @xmath79 mev , @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) that is a possible fit to both the 10  mm and 20  mm experimental data , is the accepted best fit for model  ( iii ) . using the same approach for the non - mean - field - enhanced method , models ( i ) and ( ii ) , and concentration , results in a unique set of parameter values for each model , simulation method , and concentration . 
 these accepted fits are summarized in table  2 . 
 notice in table  2 that for the accepted global minimum of model  ( iii ) , and for both mean - field - enhanced and non - mean - field - enhanced methods , the values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 are reasonably close to the ones calculated from the experimental data  @xcite using the method of ref . 
 also note that the fits for 10  mm are consistently better than the fits to the 20  mm experiments . 
 this might be due to violation of the dilute - solution limit at the higher concentration . 
 this may also be the reason that the values of @xmath82 , which are expected to be the same for both concentrations when fit to a single simulation , differ consistently by about @xmath83 mev between the concentrations . 
 the values of @xmath42 are consistently less negative for the longer - ranged lateral interactions of the mean - field - enhanced than for the non - mean - field method . 
 this is not surprising . 
 the quality of the fits is better for model  ( iii ) , as can be seen from the plots corresponding to each of the models  ( figs . 
 [ fig : bestfit ] ,  [ fig : expgamma ] ,  and  [ fig : consgamma ] ) . models ( ii ) and ( i ) fit worse at either the lower - coverage part of the isotherm ( model  ( ii ) ) , see fig . 
 [ fig : expgamma ] , or at the upper part of the isotherm ( model  ( i ) ) , see fig . 
 [ fig : consgamma ] . 
 in contrast , the best - fit simulations in fig . 
 [ fig : bestfit ] fit the experiments well over the whole range of coverages . 
 the plots for the non - mean - field - enhanced fits ( not shown ) are similar . 
 a plot of @xmath0 vs @xmath20 is shown is fig . 
 [ fig : gamma_vs_e](a ) for the best - fit values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 corresponding to the 10 mm experimental data for each of the three models considered . also shown 
 are the values of @xmath0 obtained in ref . 
 @xcite by the method of ref . 
 while model  ( ii ) is expected to fit the ref . 
 @xcite values of @xmath0 , model  ( iii ) also predicts a mean value of @xmath0 close to , but slightly more negative than , the mean of the values of @xmath0 from ref . 
 the @xmath1 values corresponding to the best fits of the three models are shown in fig . 
 [ fig : gamma_vs_e](b ) . 
 since the fits are sometimes better for the mean - field - enhanced method , and sometimes worse , the mean of the sets of parameters obtained by including and excluding the mean - field enhancement are reported here as our final results : @xmath84 , and @xmath85 mev . in the far - field approximation used here , the lateral interaction energy between two parallel dipoles separated by a distance @xmath86 is given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the dipole moment , @xmath89 is an effective `` dipolar distance , '' and the second and third equalities result from eqs . 
 ( [ eq : phi ] ) and ( [ eq : q ] ) , respectively . 
 consequently , @xmath90 for the @xmath91 mev final result , the dipole moment ranges between @xmath92  e  for @xmath93 and @xmath94  e  for @xmath95 , and the `` dipolar distance '' @xmath96   . 
 density functional theory calculations of a model without water  @xcite suggest a dipole moment of @xmath97  e ,  which is only about @xmath98 higher than the fitted value at low coverage . from nave physical intuition 
 , the dipolar distance might be expected to be of the order of the ionic diameter of cl , about @xmath99 . 
 the value of @xmath89 obtained here involves several assumptions . 
 one main assumption used is that the dipole is a classical point dipole , which should be quite reasonable as the distance between neighboring dipoles is about an order of magnitude larger than the obtained value for @xmath89 . 
 moreover , we have assumed that the interaction is a classical electrostatic dipole interaction , while there could be quantum effects at the shortest length scales . on the other hand , when viewed as a charge distribution , the dipole is expected to have a much smaller `` dipolar distance '' than navely expected  @xcite . using the relationship between the dipole moment and the helmholtz capacitance @xmath100  @xcite , @xmath101 and our values for the dipole moment and @xmath0 
 , we obtain a @xmath100 that is in the range of @xmath102 to @xmath103 @xmath104f/@xmath105 . 
 this range is comparable to the reported value of @xmath100 for ag(110 ) in chloride ion solution , @xmath106f/@xmath105  @xcite , which would yield @xmath107  . 
 this value of @xmath89 is of the same order of magnitude as our value .    finally , although models ( i ) and ( ii ) are still possible , a self - consistent ( @xmath108 ) entirely electrostatic model not only fits better to the experimental data but also , with no constraints imposed , predicts values of @xmath0 that are reasonably compatible with those obtained from the experimental data using the method of ref .  @xcite . 
 br electrosorption on the same substrate ag(100 ) displays different characteristics . 
 the electrosorption valency and the next - nearest - neighbor lateral interaction energy are not only more negative , @xmath109 and @xmath110 mev , but also independent of the coverage  @xcite . in other words , while mutual depolarization  @xcite is present for cl / ag(100 ) , this effect is not significant for br / ag(100 ) . 
 simulations of br / ag(100 ) using @xmath111 , when fit to three experimental data sets , yielded @xmath112  @xcite 
 . moreover , the value obtained for @xmath0 @xmath113 , is consistent with previous results from both simulations and experimental analysis  @xcite . 
 since cl is more electronegative than br , it is expected to have a less negative @xmath0 or a more negative resident charge , consistent with our results . 
 a discrepancy between the values of the electrosorption valency @xmath0 obtained from fitting simulations to experiments , and the value obtained from the analysis  @xcite of experimental data was reported in a previous study by abou hamad _ 
 et al . _ 
 this discrepancy suggested that the long - range interactions are dominated by electrostatic dipole / dipole effects for cl electrosorption on the ag(100 ) single crystal surface .    in this work , a large set of mc simulations ( @xmath59 simulations ) over a grid in parameter space 
 was fitted to two sets of chronocoulometry experimental data for different concentrations . 
 the existence of local minima of @xmath67 in parameter space suggests alternative models . to within the resolution of our grid and the accuracy of the experimental data 
 , we have shown that while other , simpler , models are still possible , a purely electrostatic model can be used to describe the cl / ag(100 ) system . 
 it also predicts an electrosorption valency that is compatible with the value obtained through direct experimental data analysis by the method of ref . 
 additional sets of experimental data , with different concentrations around 10 and 20 mm of the adsorbate ion , along with a finer grid in parameter space would enable a more decisive determination of the most appropriate model and its parameter values .

 cols=""^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ "" , ]","studies of lateral interactions between adsorbed particles are motivated by the need to understand the origin of the wide variety of ordered overlayers and phase transitions at fractional adsorbate coverage on metal surfaces. 
 these interactions have contributions ranging from short - range and van der waals to long - range dipole - dipole, and lattice - mediated interactions  @xcite. 
 hard - square short - range interactions and dipole - dipole long - range interactions are the major contributions to the lateral interactions for bromine adsorption on ag(100 )  @xcite. in this paper 
, we explore the validity and applicability of such a model for adsorption of chlorine on ag(100 ). 
 halide electrosorption on single - crystal metal electrode surfaces is a good model system for studying the properties of the electrode - electrolyte interface in an electrochemical cell. due to its relative simplicity 
, it can be used to distinguish between the various contributions of different parameters according to the effect of their inclusion on the overall behavior of the system. 
 a mean - field approach is not sufficient, even for the description of one of the simplest halide - electrosorption systems br / ag(100 ). 
 however, a simple lattice - gas model with constant parameters is sufficient to describe its equilibrium  @xcite, and dynamic  @xcite properties. 
 while the electrosorption of br on single - crystal ag(100 ) from aqueous solution has been extensively studied as an example of adlayer formation in an electrochemical system  @xcite, less attention has been given to the electrosorption of cl  @xcite on ag(100 ). 
 a lattice - gas model with constant parameters is not sufficient to describe cl / ag(100 ), therefore this system can be used to further investigate the nature and characteristics of the lateral interactions between the adsorbed halide atoms. in particular, we here develop a self - consistent picture of variable lattice - gas parameters based on the resident charge on the adatoms being coverage dependent or electrode - potential dependent ( through the coverage ). 
 the rest of this paper is organized as follows. in section  [ sec : ii ] 
 we describe an electrostatic model of the adlayer that is used in the simulations, the lateral interaction energies, and the monte carlo methods used. 
 a brief description of the experimental procedure is given in section  [ sec : exp ]. 
 the results of fitting the simulations to experimental data are detailed in section  [ sec : results ]. 
 finally, in section  [ sec : conclusion ], we summarize our findings and discuss the implications of our results for the understanding of halide electrosorption on single - crystal metal electrode surfaces. 
 the electrostatic model of the adlayer used in the simulations is based on the following assumptions : ( i ) the adlayer is a two - dimensional lattice of adsorbed halide atoms ; ( ii ) the electrostatic interactions between the adsorbed halide atoms are described by the coulomb potential ; ( iii ) the electrostatic interactions between the adsorbed halide atoms and the","Fluency: 4 - The summary is highly readable and grammatically correct, with only minor issues like the abrupt ending (""the electrostatic interactions between the adsorbed halide atoms and the""). The flow and coherence are strong, making it easy to follow.  

Factuality: 5 - The summary accurately reflects the source text, capturing key details about lateral interactions, the focus on chlorine adsorption, the limitations of the lattice-gas model, and the proposed self-consistent approach. No factual inaccuracies are present.  

Coverage: 4 - The summary covers the main problem (understanding lateral interactions for Cl/Ag(100)), the method (lattice-gas model with variable parameters), and key findings (insufficiency of constant parameters for Cl/Ag(100)). However, it omits minor details like the Monte Carlo methods and experimental procedure, and the ending is truncated."
"the recent measurements of the vector charmonium radiative decays to light pseudoscalars , i.e. @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , have brought surprises and interests to us . 
 earlier , the cleo collaboration  @xcite renewed the branching ratios for @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , which are consistent with the averages from 2008 particle data group  @xcite . 
 the branching ratio upper limits for @xmath20 and @xmath17 were set , which were more than one order of magnitude smaller than that for @xmath19 . 
 meanwhile , the upper limits for @xmath21 , where @xmath4 stands for pseudoscalar @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , were set to be about @xmath22 . 
 the @xmath1 radiative decays are also investigated by the besiii collaboration with the newly collected 106 million @xmath1 events , and the results turn out to be tantalizing . 
 it shows that the branching ratios for @xmath23 and @xmath17 are only at an order of @xmath24 , which are nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath19  @xcite . 
 the mysterious aspects somehow are correlated with the @xmath0 and @xmath1 data . 
 it is found that the branching ratio for @xmath25 is much smaller than those for @xmath26 and @xmath15  @xcite . 
 this could be a consequence of suppressions of gluon couplings to isovector currents . as a comparison 
 , the observation in @xmath10 is indeed puzzling . 
 the immediate question is , what drives the difference of decay patterns between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    in the literature 
 , the radiative decays of the vector charmonia attracted a lot of theoretical efforts . 
 an early study by the qcd sum rules  @xcite suggested the dominance of short - distance @xmath27 annihilations . 
 the gluon and @xmath28 transition matrix elements were computed by coupling the gluon fields to the pseudoscalar states with which the branching ratio fraction @xmath29 was satisfactorily described . in ref . 
 @xcite , the @xmath8 mixings with the light pseudoscalars @xmath6 and @xmath7 were extracted through the axial gluonic anomaly on the basis of chiral and large @xmath30 approach . by assuming that the partial widths of @xmath31 and @xmath15 were saturated by the @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing 
 , the branching ratios for @xmath31 and @xmath15 were accounted for to the correct orders of magnitude . 
 this issue was revisited by feldmann _ 
 et al . _ who proposed to extract the mixing and decay constants on the quark flavor basis  @xcite . 
 this scheme can be easily extended to accommodate the mixing of @xmath8 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 from which the @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing angles were extracted and turned out to be consistent with those from refs . 
 @xcite . 
 interestingly , the new data from besiii for @xmath32 seem to suggest a deviation from the saturation assumption . 
 it implies that some other mechanisms become important in @xmath10 , although they may not play a significant role in @xmath33 . in this work 
 , we shall show that the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model is an ideal framework to make a coherent analysis of the @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing effects and contributions from intermediate vector mesons . 
 we shall show that the @xmath10 is not saturated by the @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing . instead , one important mechanism that drives the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath10 and produces the observed patterns is the sizeable coupling of @xmath34 . 
 as follows , we first give a brief introduction to the vmd model and lay out the correlated aspects of the @xmath8-@xmath9 mixings in sec . 
 ii . the detailed analysis , calculation results and discussions 
 will then be presented in sec . 
 a brief summary will be given in sec . 
 in the vmd model ( e.g. see review of refs . 
 @xcite ) the electromagnetic ( em ) current can be decomposed into a sum of all neutral vector meson fields including both isospin-0 and isospin-1 components . 
 the leading @xmath35 effective coupling can be written as : @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the vector meson field . 
 the photon - vector - meson coupling constant @xmath38 can be extracted from the partial decay width @xmath39 . neglecting the mass of electron and positron 
 , we have @xmath40^{\frac{1}{2 } } , \label{fv}\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the electron three - vector momentum in the vector meson rest frame , and @xmath42 is the em fine - structure constant .    for the decays of @xmath43 , the vmd contributing diagrams are illustrated in fig . 
 [ fig-1 ] . 
 this classification is based on the photon producing mechanisms and related to the experimental measurements . 
 for instance , fig . 
 [ fig-1](a ) identifies such a process that the photon is connected to a hadronic vector meson fields . 
 it requires a sum over all strong transitions of @xmath44 channels .    the second process in fig .  [ fig-1](b ) is via charmonium electromagnetic ( em ) annihilations . 
 such a process generally has small contributions in comparison with the strong transitions . 
 however , it is likely that the em amplitudes may have significant effects in some exclusive decay channels . in recent series studies 
 @xcite it shows that in the hadronic decays of @xmath45 , the short ( via three gluon annihilation ) and long - distance ( fig .  [ fig-1](c ) ) transition amplitudes may have a destructive interfering mode that would efficiently reduce the strong transition amplitudes in some exclusive channels . as a consequence , the em amplitudes may become compatible with the strong ones , and manifest themselves in experimental observables . 
 this issue is related to the so - called  @xmath46 puzzle "" , which questions 
 why the branching ratio fraction @xmath47 is so strongly suppressed in comparison with the pqcd expectation values  @xcite . 
 a review of this subject and some recent progresses on this problem can be found in the literature  @xcite .    in the present work , 
 our attention is to understand whether the data for @xmath48 are consistent with those for @xmath44 , and what drives the different radiative decay patterns between @xmath0 and @xmath1 . 
 we shall adopt the available experimental measurements of @xmath44 in the calculations of the vmd contributions . 
 this means we need not worry about the detailed transition mechanisms for @xmath49 at this moment . also , by adopting the experimental data for @xmath44 , we need not consider the @xmath50 mixing processes since they have been contained in the data for @xmath49 . 
 it is worth noting in advance another feature with this classification of fig . 
 [ fig-1 ] . 
 namely , transitions between vector charmonia may also contribute . 
 for instance , @xmath51 will contribute to @xmath52 . 
 we will show later that this process is essential for understanding the radiative decay patterns for @xmath0 and @xmath10 .    apart from the transitions via fig . 
 [ fig-1 ] , another important transition is via fig . 
 [ fig-2 ] which corresponds to the @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing due to the axial vector anomaly . 
 note that the process of fig . 
 [ fig-1](a ) with an intermediate charmonium does not overlap with fig . 
 [ fig-2 ] at the hadronic level . 
 in fact , it is interesting to note their correlated features : i ) in both cases , the @xmath27 annihilate at short distances . in fig . 
 [ fig-1](a ) , the vector configuration of @xmath27 annihilates into a photon , i.e. @xmath27 in a relative @xmath53-wave with spin-1 , while in fig . 
 [ fig-2 ] the pseudoscalar @xmath27 are in a relative @xmath53-wave but with spin-0 , and then annihilates into gluons . 
 ii ) the process of fig . 
 [ fig-2 ] is through a typical magnetic dipole ( m1 ) transition of @xmath54 , which can be regarded as a non - vector - resonance contribution in respect to the vmd scenario .     in the frame of vmd . ]     and @xmath15 via @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing . ]    with the lagrangian of eq . 
 ( [ lag-1 ] ) , the transition amplitude can be expressed as @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the coupling constants for the hadronic vertex of @xmath44 , and will be determined by experimental data via @xmath57 we adopt an empirical form for the form factor  @xcite : @xmath58 where parameter @xmath59 is in a range of @xmath60 mev . 
 this form factor can be interpreted as the wavefunction overlap which would be suppressed in a large recoil momentum region for the final state particles  @xcite . 
 the incovariant form factor can also be regarded reasonable in this case . 
 the decay processes are treated in the c.m . 
 frame of the initial meson . 
 therefore , the anti - symmetric tensor structure of the interactions can always be reduced to a form of @xmath61 , which explicitly depends on the three - vector momentum of the final state vector meson . 
 note that for the anti - symmetric tensor couplings all the contributions to the transition amplitude can be absorbed into the effective coupling form factor . because of this , it is natural to expect that the form factor would contain information of meson wavefunction overlaps with an explicit three - vector - momentum dependence . in particular , 
 a harmonic oscillator potential for the quark - antiquark system will lead to a form factor similar to eq . 
 ( [ ff-01 ] ) . 
 we shall determine the form factor parameter @xmath59 combining the data for @xmath62 and @xmath3 . 
 it will then be fixed and adopted for the calculations of other channels . in the transition of fig . 
 [ fig-1](a ) , the vector meson will carry the momentum of the final state photon @xmath63 . 
 the transition amplitudes of fig . 
 [ fig-2 ] can be expressed as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the mixing angle between pseudoscalar @xmath4 and @xmath8 . 
 it has been extracted in ref . 
 @xcite , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which are also obtained by ref . 
 it should be noted that in the above equation the coupling @xmath68 is extracted from the data for @xmath69 . 
 the non - local effects from the off - shell @xmath8 at the mass of @xmath9 have been included in the mixing angles  @xcite . in the second line , we define a reduced coupling @xmath70 , which can be directly compared with the effective coupling @xmath71 in eq . 
 ( [ trans-1 ] ) . 
 we do not include the @xmath72 mixings with the @xmath9 in @xmath73 and @xmath15 since their mixing angles are relatively small . 
 nevertheless , the @xmath72 mixing effects will be further suppressed by the unknown but believe - to - be - small branching ratio for @xmath74 . 
 in table  [ tab-1 ] , the data for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath75 from pdg 2010  @xcite are listed . 
 it shows that most of the light @xmath76 channels have been measured for @xmath0 and @xmath1 hadronic decays . 
 in contrast , most of the light @xmath76 channels for @xmath77 are below the experimental precision limit except for @xmath78 . 
 as mentioned earlier , the @xmath62 channels are correlated with the so - called  @xmath46 puzzle "" in the literature . 
 however , our attention in the present work is different . we shall use the experimental data for @xmath44 as an input to investigate the role played by the vmd mechanisms in the vector charmonium radiative decays 
 this treatment means that one need not be concerned about the detailed transition mechanisms for @xmath44 at this moment since they all have been contained in the experimental data . 
 we emphasize that this should not be a trivial starting point . 
 success of such a prescription would help us clarify two major processes in the charmonium radiative decays , i.e. the relative @xmath53-wave @xmath27 annihilations would occur either via spin-1 or spin-0 configurations . 
 .branching ratios for @xmath79 from pdg 2010  @xcite . 
 the dash  - "" and dots  @xmath80 "" denote the forbidden and unavailable channels , respectively . [ 
 cols=""^,^,^,^"",options=""header "" , ]     our investigation suggests the importance of a coherent treatment for the vmd mechanism and @xmath8-@xmath9 mixings . 
 note that the charmonium pole contribution has not been included by the previous studies  @xcite . 
 meanwhile , an understanding of why the vmd and axial gluonic anomaly mechanisms play different roles in @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays would be essentially important . 
 the following points may help to clarify this question :    \i ) as mentioned earlier , there are some interesting correspondences between the axial gluonic anomaly and vmd in this case . in the axial gluonic anomaly transitions the @xmath27 annihilate into gluon fields at short distances in a relative @xmath53-wave and spin-0 , which induces mixings with the goldstone boson @xmath6 and su(3 ) flavor singlet @xmath7 . 
 the photon radiation can be regarded as from non - vector - resonance m1 transitions . in the vmd transitions via the charmonium state , the @xmath27 also annihilate at short distances in a relative @xmath53-wave , but with spin-1 . in this case , the annihilated @xmath27 couple to a photon , and radiate two soft gluons which can couple to pseudoscalar states . 
 \ii ) the difference between those two mechanisms can be well - understood quantum mechanically . for @xmath81 , the vmd transitions via @xmath1 pole 
 is relative suppressed by the @xmath82 coupling since as the first radial excited state the wavefunction of @xmath1 at the origin is smaller than that of @xmath0 . 
 in contrast , the axial - gluonic - anomaly - driving @xmath8-@xmath9 mixings will occur via @xmath83 , where the first step is a typical em m1 transition between two ground charmonium states . 
 it is allowed by the quantum transition selection rule at leading order . 
 the situation changes in @xmath84 . on the one hand , 
 the vmd transition will be dominated by the @xmath0 pole , which will be coupled to the em field . on the other hand , 
 the axial gluonic anomaly transitions via the @xmath1-@xmath8 m1 transition will be suppressed by the quantum transition selection rule at leading order . for the @xmath72-mediated transition , the @xmath72 mixings with the @xmath6 and @xmath7 
 will then be suppressed  @xcite . 
 the above qualitative argument explains why the vmd mechanism and axial gluonic anomaly play different roles in @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays , respectively , as manifested by the calculation . 
 in particular , it shows that both mechanisms are crucial for our understanding of the observed branching ratio patterns . 
 the successful account of the observed branching ratio patterns for @xmath11 in the vmd model has an important implication of the hadronic decay mechanisms for @xmath62 . 
 it shows that the  puzzling "" radiative decay patterns in @xmath11 have direct connections with the hadronic decay mechanisms , i.e. @xmath62 , instead of some other abnormal processes . as a consequence 
 , it will guide our further investigations of the transitions of @xmath62 , and impose constraints on processes such as illustrated by fig . 
 [ fig-1 ] . 
 for instance , the hadronic part of fig . 
 [ fig-1](c ) is found to be an important non - perturbative qcd mechanism that contributes predominantly in @xmath51 and @xmath85  @xcite . 
 as pointed out recently in a series of papers on the subject of non - perturbative transition mechanisms in charmonium decays  @xcite , such intermediate meson loop transitions would be an natural mechanism for evading the pqcd helicity selection rule and explaining the  @xmath46 puzzle "" in @xmath62 . 
 in brief , with the available data for @xmath62 , we show that the vmd model is still useful for our understanding of the newly measured branching ratios for @xmath86 in association with the @xmath8-@xmath9 mixings via the axial gluonic anomaly . 
 importance of such a contribution has not been recognized before . in particular 
 , we stress that the intermediate vector charmonia can have significant contributions via e.g. @xmath87 . 
 we show that these two mechanisms behave differently in @xmath0 and @xmath10 , and can be understood by state transition selection rules . 
 we also emphasize that the consistency between @xmath11 and @xmath76 demonstrated in this work would impose important constraints on the non - pqcd mechanisms in @xmath62 . 
 it would be useful for our final understanding of the long - standing  @xmath46 puzzle "" in @xmath62 .

 earlier, the cleo collaboration  @xcite renewed the branching ratios for @xmath16, @xmath17, @xmath18, and @xmath19, which are consistent with the averages from 2008 particle data group  @xcite. 
 the branching ratio upper limits for @xmath20 and @xmath17 were set, which were more than one order of magnitude smaller than that for @xmath19. 
 meanwhile, the upper limits for @xmath21, where @xmath4 stands for pseudoscalar @xmath5, @xmath6 and @xmath7, were set to be about @xmath22. 
 the @xmath1 radiative decays are also investigated by the besiii collaboration with the newly collected 106 million @xmath1 events, and the results turn out to be tantalizing. 
 it shows that the branching ratios for @xmath23 and @xmath17 are only at an order of @xmath24, which are nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath19  @xcite. 
 the mysterious aspects somehow are correlated with the @xmath0 and @xmath1 data. 
 it is found that the branching ratio for @xmath25 is much smaller than those for @xmath26 and @xmath15  @xcite. 
 this could be a consequence of suppressions of gluon couplings to isovector currents. as a comparison 
, the observation in @xmath10 is indeed puzzling. 
 the immediate question is, what drives the difference of decay patterns between @xmath0 and @xmath1.    in the literature 
, the radiative decays of the vector charmonia attracted a lot of theoretical efforts. 
 an early study by the qcd sum rules  @xcite suggested the dominance of short - distance @xmath27 annihilations. 
 the gluon and @xmath28 transition matrix elements were computed by coupling the gluon fields to the pseudoscalar states with which the branching ratio fraction @xmath29 was satisfactorily described. in ref. 
 @xcite, the @xmath8 mixings with the light pseudoscalars @xmath30 and @xmath31 were taken into account. 
 the radiative decays of @xmath32 and @xmath33 were studied in ref. 
 @xcite, where the @xmath34 mixings with the light pseudoscalars @xmath35 and @xmath36 were taken into account. 
 the radiative decays of @xmath37 and @xmath38 were studied in ref. 
 @xcite, where the @xmath39 mixings with the light pseudoscalars @xmath40 and @xmath41 were taken into account. 
 the radiative","Fluency: 3 - The summary is mostly readable and grammatically correct, but it contains some awkward phrasing and repetition (e.g., ""taken into account"" is repeated multiple times). The use of placeholders like @xmath0 and @xcite also disrupts readability, though this is likely due to the source format.  

Factuality: 2 - The summary includes some correct information from the source, but it also introduces inaccuracies and inconsistencies. For example, it misrepresents the pseudoscalar states (e.g., @xmath30 and @xmath31 are incorrectly listed as pseudoscalars, and the summary repeats the same structure for unrelated decays). The summary also omits key details from the source, such as the role of the VMD model and the specific findings about @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing.  

Coverage: 2 - The summary partially covers the main problem (differences in decay patterns between @xmath0 and @xmath1) and mentions some methods (e.g., QCD sum rules, mixing effects), but it fails to coherently summarize the key findings or the proposed solution (the VMD model). It also includes irrelevant repetitions (e.g., the redundant listing"
"non - relativistic quantum fluids ( fermions or bosons ) constrained by periodic structures , such as layered or tubular , are found in many real or man - made physical systems . 
 for example , we find electrons in layered structures such as cuprate high temperature superconductors or semiconductor superlattices , or in tubular structures like organo - metalic superconductors . on the experimental side 
 , there are a lot of experiments around bosonic gases in low dimensions , such as : bec in 2d hydrogen atoms @xcite , 2d bosonic clouds of rubidium @xcite , superfluidity in 2d @xmath1he films @xcite , while for in 1d we have the confinement of sodium @xcite , to mention a few . 
 meanwhile , for non - interacting fermions there are only a few experiments , for example , interferometry probes which have led to observe bloch oscillations @xcite . 
 to describe the behavior of fermion and boson gases inside this symmetries , several works have been published . for a review of a boson gas in optical lattices 
 see @xcite , and for fermions @xcite is very complete . most of this theoretical works use parabolic @xcite , sinusoidal @xcite and biparabolic @xcite potentials , with good results only in the low particle energy limit , where the tight - binding approximation is valid . 
 although in most of the articles mentioned above the interactions between particles and the periodic constrictions are taken simultaneously in the system description , the complexity of the many - body problem leads to only an approximate solution . 
 so that the effects of interactions and constrictions in the properties of the system , are mixed and indistinguishable . 
 in this work we are interested in analyzing the effect of the structure on the properties of the quantum gases regardless of the effect of the interactions between the elements of the gas , which we do as precisely as the accuracy of the machines allows us to do . 
 this paper unfolds as follows : in sec . 
 2 we describe our model which consists of quantum particles gas in an infinitely large box where we introduce layers of null width separated by intervals of periodicity @xmath2 . in sec . 
 3 we obtain the grand potential for a boson and for a fermion gas either inside a multilayer or a multitube structure . from these grand potentials we calculate the chemical potential and specific heat , which are compared with the properties of the infinite ideal gas . in sec . 
 4 we discuss results , and give our conclusions . 
 we consider a system of @xmath3 non - interacting particles , either fermions or bosons , with mass @xmath4 for bosons or @xmath5 for fermions respectively , within layers or tubes of separation @xmath6 , @xmath7 = @xmath8 or @xmath9 , and width @xmath10 , which we model as periodic arrays of delta potentials either in the @xmath11-direction and free in the other two directions for planes , and two perpendicular delta potentials in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 directions and free in the @xmath11 one for tubes . 
 the procedure used here is described in detail in refs . @xcite and @xcite for a boson gas , where we model walls in all the constrained directions using dirac comb  potentials . in every case , 
 the schrdinger equation for the particles is separable in @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath11 so that the single - particle energy as a function of the momentum @xmath12 is @xmath13 . 
 for the directions where the particles move freely we have the customary dispertion relation @xmath14 , with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and we are assuming periodic boundary conditions in a box of size @xmath17 . 
 meanwhile , in the constrained directions , @xmath11 for planes and @xmath18 for tubes , the energies are implicitly obtained through the transcendental equation @xcite @xmath19 with @xmath20 , and the dimensionless parameter @xmath21 represents the layer impenetrability in terms of the strength of the delta potential @xmath22 . 
 we redefine @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the thermal wave length of an ideal gas inside an infinite box , with @xmath25 the fermi energy and @xmath26 is the density of the gas .    the energy solution of eq . 
 ( [ kpsol ] ) for has been extensively analized in refs . @xcite and @xcite , where the allowed and forbidden energy - band structure is shown , and the importance of taking the full band spectrum has been demonstrated . 
 every thermodynamic property may be obtained starting from the grand potential of the system under study , whose generalized form is @xcite @xmath27\bigr\ } ,   \label{omega}\ ] ] where @xmath28 for bosons , 1 for fermions and 0 for the classical gas , @xmath29 is the kronecker delta function and @xmath30 . 
 the ground state contribution @xmath31 , which is representative of the bose gas , is not present when we analyze the fermi gas .    for a boson gas 
 inside multilayers we go through the algebra described in @xcite , and taking the thermodynamic limit one arrives to @xmath32\bigr ) \nonumber \\ & & -\frac{1}{\beta ^{2}}\frac{l^{3}m}{\left ( 2\pi \right)^{2}\hbar ^{2 } }   { \int_{-\infty } ^{\infty } dk_{z}}g_{2 } \bigl\{\exp [ -\beta ( \varepsilon _ { k_{z}}-\mu)]\bigr\}.    \label{omegaboson}\end{aligned}\ ] ] meanwhile , for a fermion gas we get @xmath33\bigr\ } ,    \label{omegafermion}\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the bose and fermi - dirac functions @xcite . 
 the spin degeneracy has been taken into account for the development of eq . 
 ( [ omegafermion ] ) . 
 on the other hand , for a multitube structure we have @xmath36 \nonumber \\ & & -\frac{l^{3}m^{1/2}}{\left ( 2\pi \right ) ^{5/2}\hbar } \frac{1}{\beta ^{3/2 } } \int_{-\infty } ^{\infty } \int_{-\infty } ^{\infty } dk_{x}\ dk_{y}g_{3/2}(e^{-\beta ( \varepsilon _ { k_{x}}+\varepsilon _ { k_{y}}-\mu ) } ) \label{tubosboson}\end{aligned}\ ] ] for a boson gas , and @xmath37\bigr\ } \label{tubosfermion}\ ] ] for a fermion gas .    for calculation matters , 
 it is useful to split the infinite integrals into an number @xmath38 of integrals running over the energy bands , taking @xmath38 as large as necessary to acquire convergence .      for a gas inside a multilayer structure , the particle number @xmath3 is directly obtained from eqs . ( [ omegaboson ] ) and ( [ omegafermion ] ) . 
 important characteristics can be extracted , such as the critical temperature for a condensating boson gas and the influence of the system parameters on it , @xmath2 and @xmath39 , already reported in refs . 
 but for the case of a fermion gas , we focus on the chemical potential since it is closely related to the fermi energy of the system . in this case 
 the number equation is @xmath40\ \bigr\ } ,   \label{numfer}\ ] ] from which we are able to numerically extract the fermi energy of the system , which corresponds to the chemical potential for @xmath41 , over the fermi energy of the ifg @xmath42 , namely @xmath43 , as a function of the impenetrability parameter @xmath39 , whose behavior corresponds to a monotonically increasing curve as @xmath39 increases , being more evident for smaller values of @xmath44 . 
 another important feature is the chemical potential of the system over its fermi energy , @xmath45 as a function of the temperature in units of the fermi temperature @xmath46 , fig [ muvst ] , for a given value of @xmath47 . 
 there is a special interest in fig [ muvst ] , since for certain geometrical configurations the chemical potential shows an anomalous behavior , as will be shown later . 
 also , in this last figure one may notice that for @xmath48 the 3d ifg behavior for the chemical potential is recovered , and that the curve crosses the @xmath8 axis in @xmath49 , as has been reported in @xcite . 
 meanwhile , as @xmath50 , we have a fermion gas inside a two dimension structure , giving a zero chemical potential at @xmath51 , as expected .     for planes with @xmath52 and different values of @xmath44 . 
 ]    [ muvst ]     for multitubes with @xmath53 and different values of @xmath39 . ] 
 we make a similar procedure for the boson an fermi gases inside a multitube structure , the first one being reported in @xcite . 
 but for a fermion gas we start from the equation @xmath54\bigr\ }   \label{fermtubos}\ ] ] and extract the chemical potential over the fermi energy of the system , @xmath45 , which is probably the feature that attracts greater attention due to its anomalous behavior shown in fig . 
 [ muvsttubos ] , which shows up as an unexpected small hump . 
 another interesting characteristic is that the chemical potential over the ifg fermi energy in every case is lifted as @xmath39 increases due to the presence of the layers , in the same way as the chemical potential of the boson gas started above zero . 
 the _ specific heat _ of a boson gas has been reported in ref . 
 @xcite where we can observe a transition from a 3d system to a 2d one , which becomes evident for certain parameter values and sufficiently high temperatures . at this point is where the advantages of summing over a great amount of allowed energy bands shows its relevance . 
 meanwhile , the specific heat for a fermion gas inside layered arrays is obtained going through the derivatives of eqs . 
 ( [ omegaboson ] ) and ( [ tubosfermion ] ) , leading , after some algebra , to @xmath55\bigr\ }   \nonumber \\ & & + 2{\int_{-\infty } ^{\infty } dk_{z } }   \ln \bigl\{1+\exp [ -\beta ( \varepsilon _ { k_{z}}-\mu ) ] \bigr\ } \{2\varepsilon _ { k_{z}}-\mu + t\frac{d\mu } { dt}\ }   \nonumber \\ & & + 2\beta { \int_{-\infty } ^{\infty } dk_{z}}\frac{\varepsilon _ { k_{z } } \bigl\{\varepsilon_{k_{z}}-\mu + t\frac{d\mu } { dt}\bigr\}}{\exp   \bigl\{\beta ( \varepsilon_{k_{z}}-\mu ) \bigr\}+1 } \bigr\ }   \label{cvfermiones}\end{aligned}\ ] ] for multiplanes , and @xmath56 for multitubes .     for a fermion gas in multilayers . ]     for a fermion gas in multitubes . ]    in figs . 
 [ cvlayers ] and [ cvtubos ] we show the behavior of the specific heat of layers with a separation among layers of @xmath57 and several impenetrability intensities @xmath39 , as a function of the temperature over the system s fermi temperature . 
 it may be observed that , as the barriers disappear ( @xmath48 ) , one recovers the ifg specific heat classical value , @xmath58 . 
 it is also noticeable that as the value of @xmath59 diminishes , a dimensional crossover signature from 3d to 2d becomes evident , since the the first minimum ( going from right to left ) in the specific heat deepens towards a value @xmath60 and broadens as @xmath39 increases . in fig . 
 [ cvtubos ] the dimensional crossover from 3d to 1d is very noticeable as the mentioned minimum drops down to the value @xmath61 which corresponds to one - dimension . 
 in summary , we have calculated the thermodynamic properties of ideal boson and fermion gases inside periodical structures . in our model 
 the multilayers and multitubes are generated with dirac - comb potentials in either one or two directions , while the particles are free in the remaining directions . 
 just by introducing the planes , the translational symmetry of the particles is broken . 
 this fact reflects in every thermodynamic property of the constrained system . 
 in particular , fermions in multi - tubes progress from a 3d behavior to that 2d and finally to 1d as the wall impenetrability is increased , which is observed in the curves of the specific heat as a function of temperature . 
 there is a critical value of the wall impenetrability for which the system begins to behave in dimensions less than two , which is signaled by the appearance of an anomalous chemical potential . 
 bosons in multitubes show similar dimensional crossover like that expressed by fermions , in addition to the bose - einstein condensation at temperatures below the critical temperature of a ideal bose - gas with the same particle density . +

The repetition of sections and lack of smooth transitions reduce fluency.  

Factuality: 4 - The summary accurately reflects the source, including key details about quantum fluids, experimental examples, and the paper's focus on structure effects. However, minor inaccuracies (e.g., redundant section descriptions) slightly detract from factuality.  

Coverage: 4 - The summary covers the main problem (effects of periodic structures on quantum gases), method (modeling with delta potentials and calculating thermodynamic properties), and key findings (comparison with literature). However, it misses some technical specifics (e.g., the transcendental equation for energy) and includes redundant organizational details."
"experimental studies of neutrino oscillations have provided us with compelling evidence that neutrinos have masses and lepton flavors mix . among various theoretical models , 
 the famous seesaw mechanism @xcite provides us with a very natural description of why the masses of the three known neutrinos are so small compared to the masses of the other standard model ( sm ) fermions . in the simplest type - i seesaw model , heavy right - handed neutrinos with a mass scale @xmath0 
 are introduced in addition to the sm particle content . in order to stabilize the masses of the light neutrinos around the sub - ev scale , 
 @xmath1 is naturally expected , if the dirac mass @xmath2 between the left- and right - handed neutrinos is comparable with the mass of the top quark . 
 the testability of conventional seesaw models is therefore questionable . 
 furthermore , the heavy right - handed neutrinos potentially contribute to the hierarchy problem through loop corrections to the higgs potential , unless a supersymmetric framework is considered . 
 the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will soon start to probe tev scale physics , and the question of whether we can find hints on the neutrino mass generation mechanism at the lhc or not is relevant and interesting . 
 there are several indications that new physics will show up at the tev scale , in particular theories that are able to stabilize the higgs mass and to solve the gauge hierarchy problem . 
 the geometric mean of the planck mass and the @xmath3 k background temperature also suggests that 1 tev is the maximum mass that any cosmologically stable perturbatively coupled elementary particle can have , otherwise the density of the universe exceeds its critical value @xcite . within the seesaw framework , for the purpose of lowering the seesaw scale without spoiling the naturalness criterion , 
 some underlying symmetry preserving the lepton number , @xmath4 , is usually incorporated . 
 for example , in the type - i seesaw with more than one heavy right - handed neutrino , contributions to the light - neutrino masses from different right - handed neutrinos may cancel each other due to the symmetry , which results in massless left - handed neutrinos after integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom from the theory @xcite . 
 such a low - scale fermionic seesaw mechanism may not be able to stabilize the masses of the light neutrinos , since loop corrections may be unacceptably large . a possible way to avoid this problem of the type - i seesaw model 
 is given by the inverse seesaw model , which contains a majorana insertion used to reduce the @xmath5 scale @xcite . 
 in the type - ii seesaw model , extending the sm with an @xmath6 triplet higgs scalar @xcite , the coupling between the triplet and the sm higgs scalar breaks lepton number explicitly and is expected to be very small . 
 thus , the masses of the light neutrinos are suppressed through the approximate symmetry . in general , the canonical leptogenesis mechanism @xcite , which provides a very attractive description of the origin of the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe , does not work for the low - scale seesaw mechanisms unless severe fine - tuning is invoked @xcite .    in this paper 
 , we employ the alternative framework of extra spacetime dimensions , where the fundamental grand unified scale and the planck scale are lowered in a natural way @xcite . 
 we work exclusively within the context of flat extra dimensions . in our higher - dimensional seesaw model , 
 a truncating scale restoring the renormalizability of the theory plays the role of breaking @xmath5 , so that the masses of the light neutrinos are suppressed , while the lower kaluza  klein ( kk ) states can be searched for at the lhc . 
 significant low - energy non - unitary leptonic mixing , due to integrating out the heavy kk states , could give observable phenomena in future neutrino oscillation experiments , such as a neutrino factory @xcite . 
 in addition , resonant leptogenesis could possibly be achieved in this model . for earlier studies of the generation of small neutrino masses in the context of extra dimensions , 
 see for example refs . 
 a study of unitarity violation in scenarios with bulk gauge singlet neutrinos was performed in ref . 
 an alternative higher - dimensional seesaw model was investigated in ref . 
 @xcite . 
 the remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows : first , in sec . 
 [ sec : introduction ] , we present the general formalism of our model . then , in sec .  [ sec : nu ] , we show explicitly how sizable non - unitarity effects emerge in the leptonic flavor mixing . 
 section [ sec : lhc ] is devoted to the collider signatures and the discovery potential of the heavy kk modes at the lhc . 
 we comment on the origin of baryon number asymmetry in our model in sec . 
 [ sec : leptogenesis ] . 
 finally , a summary and our conclusions are given in sec . 
 [ sec : summary ] . 
 we consider a brane world theory with a five - dimensional bulk , where the sm particles are confined to the brane . 
 we also introduce three sm singlet fermions @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) @xcite . 
 being singlets , they are not restricted to the brane and can propagate in the extra spacetime dimensions . 
 the action responsible for the neutrino masses is given by @xmath9 \nonumber \\ &   & + \int_{y=0 } { \rm d}^4 x \left ( - \frac{1}{\sqrt{m_s } } \overline{\nu_{\rm l } } \hat m^c \psi - \frac{1}{\sqrt{m_s } } \overline{\nu^c_{\rm l } } \hat m \psi + { \rm h.c.}\right),\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the coordinate along the extra compactified dimension and @xmath11 denotes the mass scale of the higher - dimensional theory . 
 note that , although @xmath12 is defined in the same way as in four dimensions , it does not represent the charge conjugate of @xmath13 in five dimensions @xcite , and hence , the term @xmath14 is not a majorana mass term . 
 however , in the four - dimensional theory , it leads to effective majorana mass terms for the kk modes of @xmath13 . due to the freedom in the choice of basis for the singlet fermion fields , 
 one can always apply a unitary transformation in flavor space in order to diagonalize @xmath0 . without loss of generality 
 , we will therefore work in a basis in which @xmath15 is real and diagonal . 
 the dirac masses @xmath16 and @xmath17 could be generated by couplings of the bulk neutrinos to a brane - localized higgs boson receiving a vacuum expectation value . 
 we decompose the spinors of the bulk singlet fermions into two two - component objects : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 . 
 since the extra dimension is compactified on the @xmath20 orbifold , the kk modes of @xmath21 and @xmath22 are four - dimensional weyl spinors . 
 we take @xmath21 to be even under the @xmath23 transformation @xmath24 , while @xmath25 is taken to be odd . 
 thus , in eq .  , the @xmath17 term corresponding to the coupling between @xmath26 and @xmath25 is not allowed . 
 the kk expansions of @xmath21 and @xmath25 are given by @xmath27 in general , an extra - dimensional model must be viewed as an effective theory , since it is non - renormalizable . 
 this means that the kk towers are expected not to be infinite , but truncated after a finite number of levels . 
 the nature of this cutoff depends on the specific ultraviolet ( uv ) completion of the model , which is not known . here 
 , we impose a truncation of the kk towers at a maximum kk index @xmath28 . 
 a cutoff of this kind arises , for example , in deconstructed models of extra dimensions @xcite . in general , other kinds of truncation schemes 
 are possible , but the one that we consider has the virtue of giving rise to a mechanism for generating small neutrino masses from the tops of the kk towers , as will be discussed below .    inserting the above expansion into eq .   and integrating over the compactified extra dimension , we arrive at the following form for the four - dimensional action @xmath29 \right . 
 \nonumber \\ & & \phantom{\int d^4 x}-\left . 
 { \rm i }   \left(\nu_{\rm l}^t \sigma^2 m_{\rm d } \xi^{(0 ) } + \sqrt{2 } \sum^n_{n=1 } \nu_{\rm l}^t \sigma^2 m_{\rm d } \xi^{(n ) } + { \rm h.c . } 
 \right ) \right\},\end{aligned}\ ] ] where , written in block - form , the mass matrix @xmath30 for the kk modes at the @xmath31th level takes the form @xmath32 the dirac mass term is then given by @xmath33 . 
 for the purpose of simplicity in the following discussion , we define the linear combinations @xmath34 for @xmath35 . 
 the full mass matrix in the basis @xmath36 then reads @xmath37 the scale of @xmath0 is not governed by the electroweak symmetry breaking , and hence , one can expect that @xmath38 holds . then , by approximately solving the eigenvalue equation of the matrix in eq .   with respect to the small ratio @xmath39 , the light - neutrino mass matrix is found to be @xmath40    in refs . 
 @xcite , the limit @xmath41 is considered , and the light - neutrino mass matrix is then given by @xmath42 the masses of the light neutrinos are suppressed only if @xmath43 in the denominator of eq . 
 is very large . 
 therefore , a severe fine - tuning between @xmath44 and @xmath45 has to be invoked , which appears quite unnatural . 
 however , bare majorana masses of the form @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is an odd integer , emerge naturally from the sherk  schwarz decomposition in string theory as a requirement of topological constraints , and hence , such relations do not suffer any fine - tuning problems ( see detailed discussions in ref . 
 @xcite ) . with our chosen cutoff scheme , together with the above condition on @xmath48 , lepton number violation will be induced only at the top of the kk tower , as we will see shortly . 
 there could , of course , be other lepton number violating processes at some intermediate point , but we choose to treat the simple scenario where the cutoff is the only source . 
 one can easily prove that , in the simplest case @xmath49 , the light - neutrino mass matrix is given by @xmath50 instead of a large mass scale @xmath0 for the singlet fermions , the light - neutrino masses are suppressed by the large cutoff scale @xmath51 . 
 we consider the interesting case where the scale of the uv completion is much larger than the scale of the extra dimension @xmath52 and the singlet fermion masses , _ i.e. _ , we assume @xmath53 to hold . in this limit , the neutrino mass matrix is simply given by @xmath54 , _ 
 i.e. _ , the scale of the neutrino masses is determined by a high - energy scale associated with the fundamental theory underlying the effective extra - dimensional model . as for the heavy kk modes , from eq . 
 , the masses of the @xmath31th excited kk modes are given by @xmath55 as we will discuss later , this implies that @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( as well as @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) form dirac pairs . 
 thus , lepton number can be assigned to these pairs and the lepton number violating effects , such as neutrino masses , can only arise from the unpaired @xmath60 at the top of the kk tower . 
 in order to compute the effective low - energy leptonic mixing , we first consider the light - neutrino mass matrix . generally , @xmath61 is a complex symmetric matrix , and can be diagonalized by means of a unitary matrix @xmath62 as @xmath63 where @xmath64 , with @xmath65 being the masses of the light neutrinos . 
 note that , similarly to the ordinary fermionic seesaw mechanism , the light neutrinos mix with the heavy kk modes . 
 thus , @xmath62 is not the exact leptonic mixing matrix entering into neutrino oscillations , even if one works in a basis where the charged - lepton mass matrix is diagonal . to see this point clearly 
 , we can fully diagonalize eq .   and then write down the neutrino flavor eigenstates in terms of the mass eigenstates @xmath66,\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath67 denotes the mass eigenstates of the light neutrinos , and @xmath68 is the upper - left @xmath69 sub - matrix of the complete mixing matrix containing the light neutrinos as well as the full kk tower for the singlet fermions . 
 furthermore , we have introduced the quantities @xmath70 which represent the mixing between the light neutrinos and the kk modes . 
 the charged - current lagrangian in mass basis can be rewritten as @xmath71w^-_\mu + { \rm h.c.},\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the @xmath6 coupling constant . 
 due to the existence of the kk modes , the light - neutrino mixing matrix is no longer unitary . to a very good precision , we have @xmath73 assuming that @xmath74 , eq 
 .   can be approximated by @xmath75 compared to the conventional parametrization of non - unitarity effects @xmath76 @xcite , where @xmath77 is a hermitian matrix , we thus obtain @xmath78 an interesting feature of eq 
 .   arises immediately : the non - unitarity effects are dominated only by the combination @xmath79 . as a rough estimate , 
 if we keep @xmath52 at the tev scale and @xmath80 , @xmath81 can be naturally expected . 
 another typical feature is that , if @xmath82 holds , then both the neutrino mixing and the non - unitarity effects are determined by a single dirac mass matrix @xmath2 . 
 therefore , in such a realistic low - scale extra - dimensional model , the non - unitarity effects are strongly correlated with the neutrino mixing matrix and the radius of the extra spacetime dimension .    in our numerical computations , 
 we adopt a convenient parametrization @xcite , and rewrite @xmath2 as @xmath83 with @xmath84 being an arbitrary complex orthogonal matrix . with this parametrization , eq 
 .   takes the form @xmath85    the present bounds at 90  % c.l . on the non - unitarity parameters are given by @xcite @xmath86 where the most severe constraint is that on the @xmath87 element , coming from the @xmath88 decay . 
 however , in the case that @xmath0 lies below the electroweak scale , but above a few gev , the @xmath88 constraint is lost due to the restoration of the glashow 
 iliopoulos  maiani ( gim ) mechanism @xcite , and a less stringent bound of @xmath89 should be used . 
 apart from resulting in non - unitarity effects in neutrino mixing , the heavy singlet fermions in the bulk will also contribute to the lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) decays of charged leptons , _ 
 e.g. _ , @xmath88 and @xmath90 , through the loop exchange of kk modes @xcite . 
 different from the standard type - i seesaw mechanism , the corresponding branching ratios are not dramatically suppressed by the light - neutrino masses , but only driven down by the factor @xmath91 defined in eq .  . 
 thus , appreciable lfv rates could be obtained . 
 as shown in eq .  , the heavy singlets @xmath59 , @xmath56 , and @xmath92 couple to the gauge sector of the sm , and thus , if kinematically accessible , they could be produced at hadron colliders . for a quantitative discussion , 
 we now restrict ourselves to the simplest case @xmath93 . 
 note that @xmath59 and @xmath58 are two - component majorana fields with equal masses but opposite cp parities @xcite . 
 thus , they are equivalent to a single dirac field @xmath94 with @xmath95 $ ] , @xmath96 $ ] , and mass @xmath97 . similarly , @xmath98 can be combined with @xmath99 , and hence , forms a higher kk dirac mode with @xmath100 $ ] and mass @xmath101 . as a general result of the mass degeneracy , all the kk modes are paired together except for the highest mode @xmath60 with mass @xmath102 . 
 actually , @xmath60 is now the sole source of lepton number violation , and thus , gives rise to the masses of the light neutrinos , which can also be seen from eq .  . 
 the structure of the singlet dirac and majorana fermions is schematically depicted in fig . 
 [ fig : dirac ] . 
 illustration of the construction of dirac particles from pairs of modes in the kk tower . 
 two heavy kk majorana modes with equal masses , but opposite cp parities , can be grouped together , as shown with double lines , in order to form a dirac particle . in the case 
 @xmath103 ( left column ) , the heaviest mode @xmath60 is left , while for the case @xmath104 ( right column ) , there are three modes left : @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath60.,width=604 ]    the weak interaction lagrangian for the heavy states can now be rewritten as @xmath107w^-_\mu + { \rm h.c .

 @xmath111 ( where @xmath112 denotes the higgs mass ) , the heavy kk modes decay in the channels @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 . 
 the corresponding partial decay widths are given by @xcite @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 denote that masses of @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively . 
 since the lower kk modes are dirac particles , and lepton number breaking occurs only at the top of the kk towers , we focus our attention on lepton number conserving channels mediated by the lightest kk modes . 
 for example , an interesting channel is the production of three charged leptons and missing energy @xcite , _ 
 i.e. _ , @xmath121 , which is depicted in fig . 
 [ fig : lhc ] . 
 feynman diagrams for the potentially interesting lhc signatures with three charged leptons and missing energy in the model under consideration.,width=302 ]    another possible process is the pair production of charged leptons with different flavor and zero missing energy , _ 
 i.e. _ , @xmath122 
 . however , it is difficult to make significant observations in this channel at the lhc , due to the large sm background @xcite . 
 an analysis of the collider signatures of an extra - dimensional model similar to the one that we consider was performed in ref . 
 it was found that the most promising channel for that model is three leptons and large missing energy . 
 since taus are difficult to detect , due to their short lifetime , only electrons and muons in the final state were considered . 
 the signals were combined into two classes , the @xmath123 signal , given by the sum of the @xmath124 and @xmath125 signals , where @xmath126 and @xmath127 denote both leptons and antileptons of the indicated flavors , and the @xmath128 signal , given by the sum of the @xmath129 and @xmath130 signals . for the case of normal neutrino mass hierarchy ( @xmath131 ) , it was found that the @xmath123 combination gives the most promising signal . in order to reduce the sm background , which mainly comes from decays of @xmath119 bosons , the following kinematic cuts , taken from ref . 
 @xcite , were adopted : i ) the two like - sign leptons must each have a transverse momentum larger than 30 gev and ii ) the invariant masses from the two opposite - sign lepton pairs must each be separated from the mass of the @xmath119 boson by at least 10 gev . only the effects of the lowest kk level 
 were considered , as it was concluded that the contributions from higher modes would be more than one order of magnitude smaller . 
 we have calculated the @xmath123 as well as the @xmath128 signals for our model . 
 the results , using an integrated luminosity of @xmath132 , are shown in fig . 
 [ fig : lhcsignals ] . 
 we have considered the normal neutrino mass hierarchy ( @xmath131 ) as well as the inverted hierarchy ( @xmath133 ) , and for each case , we have chosen the mass of the lightest neutrino to be equal to zero or @xmath134 ev , corresponding to the hierarchical or nearly degenerate neutrino mass spectrum , respectively . for the neutrino oscillation parameters 
 , we have used the best - fit values from ref . 
 @xcite , _ i.e. _ , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 . 
 we have put the dirac cp - violating phase to zero . for each case , we have set the value of the cutoff scale in order to maximize the signal , while respecting the non - unitarity bounds given in eq .  . like ref . 
 @xcite , we have only taken the lightest kk modes of the singlet fermions into account . 
 the signals are dominated by the on - shell production of the internal gauge bosons and sterile fermions . since @xmath140 , on - shell production of the gauge bosons is not possible if @xmath141 , and in that case , the signals are suppressed by the off - shell propagators . 
 hence , we have chosen @xmath142 as the lower bound in our figures .    in the case that the lightest neutrino is massless , the @xmath123 signal is stronger than the @xmath128 signal by approximately one order of magnitude for the normal hierarchy , while the opposite is true for the inverted hierarchy . in the case of a nearly degenerate mass spectrum , _ 
 i.e. _ , that the lightest neutrino has a non - zero mass equal to 0.1 ev , the two signals are almost identical , especially in the inverted hierarchy case . 
 since the expected background , after the kinematic cuts have been imposed , is of the order of 100 events @xcite and none of the signals is stronger than @xmath143 events , we conclude that , for our model , the non - unitarity bounds are strong enough to rule out the part of the parameter space that could possibly be probed by the lhc .     the expected number of events for the @xmath123 and @xmath128 signals at the lhc as functions of the inverse radius @xmath45 , for an integrated luminosity of @xmath144 . note that the masses of the lightest singlet fermions are equal to @xmath145 . for @xmath141 , on - shell production of the internal gauge bosons is not possible , and the signal is suppressed .

 baryogenesis via leptogenesis is one of the main candidates for being the theory appropriately describing the production of a baryon asymmetry in the early universe , which is measured to be @xmath146  @xcite . in its most basic form 
 , leptogenesis occurs in a type - i seesaw scenario , where a net lepton asymmetry is produced through the out - of - equilibrium decay of the heavy neutrinos and then partially converted to a baryon asymmetry through sphaleron processes . 
 the sakharov conditions @xcite are fulfilled by the decays occurring out of equilibrium , the loop level cp - violation of the decays through complex yukawa couplings , and the baryon number violation of the sphalerons , respectively . 
 usually , the net lepton number is produced by the decays of the lightest singlet fermions , since asymmetries produced by the heavier neutrinos will be washed out . 
 however , in our scenario , the tower of dirac fermions can be given definite lepton number assignments and lepton number violation only occurs at the top of the tower through the unpaired @xmath147-states , which could take on the role of the singlet fermions in the basic scenario . 
 it is important to note that for @xmath93 ( @xmath148 ) , there will be no net lepton number violation , since all of the three unpaired states will be degenerate in mass . 
 however , if the @xmath47 are different , _ 
 e.g. _ , @xmath149 and @xmath150 , @xmath151 , then @xmath152 ( see fig . 
 [ fig : dirac ] ) will be the unique lightest majorana state and a net lepton asymmetry could be produced . 
 since the mass splitting of @xmath52 between the @xmath147-states is expected to be very small compared to the masses , the model would have to be treated within the framework of resonant leptogenesis @xcite . 
 furthermore , to accurately examine the prospects for leptogenesis in this model , one would have to properly take into account the effects of the dirac tower . 
 even if the dirac fermions in the tower preserve lepton number , they do not participate in the sphaleron processes , since they are sm singlets , which could hide some part of the produced lepton number from the sphalerons if all dirac fermions do not decay before sphaleron processes become inactive . 
 thus , a detailed analysis , which is beyond the scope of this paper , would be required to properly analyze the prospects for leptogenesis in this model .    for earlier studies of leptogenesis in extra dimensions , 
 see for example refs . 
 in this work , we have studied a possible mechanism for generating small neutrino masses in the context of extra dimensions . in the model that we consider , 
 the sm particles are confined to a four - dimensional brane , while three sm singlet fermions are allowed to propagate in an extra dimension , compactified on the @xmath153 orbifold . since extra - dimensional models are generally non - renormalizable , and can only be considered as effective theories , the kk expansions of the higher - dimensional fields are expected to be truncated at some cutoff scale . 
 we have imposed a cut on the kk number , truncating the towers at @xmath28 .    in the case that the bulk majorana mass term for the singlet fermions has the form @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is an odd integer , the kk modes of the singlet fermions pair to form dirac fermions . 
 such a form for a majorana mass is motivated by , for example , the scherk  schwarz mechanism . due to the truncation of the kk towers , 
 a number of unpaired majorana fermions remain at the top of each kk tower , and these are the only sources of lepton number violation in this model . 
 if the cutoff scale is large , small masses for the left - handed neutrinos are naturally generated . 
 due to mixing between the light neutrinos and the kk modes of the singlet fermions , large non - unitarity effects can be induced . 
 since the masses of the light neutrinos are generated by the top of each tower , these non - unitarity effects are not suppressed by the light - neutrino masses . 
 current bounds on the non - unitarity parameters have constrained the parameter space of the model . 
 finally , we have considered the prospects of observing the effects of the lowest kk modes of the singlet fermions at the lhc . in particular , we have considered the three leptons and large missing energy signal , which has previously been found to be promising for a similar model . 
 we have found that , in contrast to the previous results in the literature , the potential of discovering such models at the lhc is actually pessimistic . in particular , the parts of the parameter space that could be probed at the lhc are ruled out by the bounds imposed by the stringent constraints on the effective low - energy leptonic mixing . 
 however , the non - unitarity effects in neutrino oscillations could be observable at future neutrino factory experiments . 
 therefore , future long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments could play a very complementary role in searching for hints of extra dimensions .

 the famous seesaw mechanism @xcite provides us with a very natural description of why the masses of the three known neutrinos are so small compared to the masses of the other standard model ( sm ) fermions. in the simplest type - i seesaw model, heavy right - handed neutrinos with a mass scale @xmath0 
 are introduced in addition to the sm particle content. in order to stabilize the masses of the light neutrinos around the sub - ev scale, 
 @xmath1 is naturally expected, if the dirac mass @xmath2 between the left- and right - handed neutrinos is comparable with the mass of the top quark. 
 the testability of conventional seesaw models is therefore questionable. 
 furthermore, the heavy right - handed neutrinos potentially contribute to the hierarchy problem through loop corrections to the higgs potential, unless a supersymmetric framework is considered. 
 the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will soon start to probe tev scale physics, and the question of whether we can find hints on the neutrino mass generation mechanism at the lhc or not is relevant and interesting. 
 there are several indications that new physics will show up at the tev scale, in particular theories that are able to stabilize the higgs mass and to solve the gauge hierarchy problem. 
 the geometric mean of the planck mass and the @xmath3 k background temperature also suggests that 1 tev is the maximum mass that any cosmologically stable perturbatively coupled elementary particle can have, otherwise the density of the universe exceeds its critical value @xcite. within the seesaw framework, for the purpose of lowering the seesaw scale without spoiling the naturalness criterion, 
 some underlying symmetry preserving the lepton number, @xmath4, is usually incorporated. 
 for example, in the type - i seesaw with more than one heavy right - handed neutrino, contributions to the light - neutrino masses from different right - handed neutrinos may cancel each other due to the symmetry, which results in massless left - handed neutrinos after integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom from the theory @xcite. 
 such a low - scale fermionic seesaw mechanism may not be able to stabilize the masses of the light neutrinos, since loop corrections may be unacceptably large. a possible way to avoid this problem of the type - i seesaw is to consider a type - ii seesaw mechanism, where the heavy right - handed neutrinos are introduced in addition to the sm particle content, but the heavy right - handed neutrinos do not contribute to the light - neutrino masses @xcite. in the type - ii seesaw 
, the heavy right - handed neutrinos are introduced in addition to the sm particle content, but the heavy right - handed neutrinos do not contribute to the light - neutrino masses @xcite. in the type - ii seesaw 
, the heavy right - handed neutrinos are introduced in addition to the sm particle content,","Fluency: 3 - The summary is mostly readable and grammatically correct, but it contains repetitive phrases (e.g., ""in the type - ii seesaw, the heavy right - handed neutrinos are introduced..."") and lacks smooth transitions between ideas.  

Factuality: 4 - The summary accurately reflects the source material, but it misrepresents the type-II seesaw mechanism by incorrectly stating that heavy right-handed neutrinos do not contribute to light-neutrino masses (they are not part of type-II seesaw, which instead introduces a Higgs triplet).  

Coverage: 3 - The summary covers the main problem (neutrino mass generation) and some methods (seesaw mechanisms), but it misses key findings (e.g., the role of extra dimensions, KK states, and non-unitary mixing in the proposed model) and repeats information without advancing the discussion."
